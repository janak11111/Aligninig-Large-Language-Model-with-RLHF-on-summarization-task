Moved in together at 9 months Originally posted in /r/childfree  but after reading through the comments it sounds like i need a more objective opinion than a group of people who specifically don't want kids ever.\n\nAfter we had our talk about kids and we both kinda realized that our relationship was likely doomed she has gone out all night long and didnt bother calling me or anything to come pick her up. This is not behavior that she ever does so I kinda got suspicious and looked at her text messages on her phone. I now know she is not telling me the whole truth about what went on the two nights out and she is definitely texting a guy she met at the bar the first night out.\n\n I just find it shocking that she can so quickly start looking for another guy. I am still trying to heal and recover from this relationship possibly being lost.\n\nWhere do i find the strength to end this relationship and how the hell do i cope with the moments of anguish and despair I am going to feel throughout the next month?",

I then get a facebook message from Harvey, firmly uninviting me. It was because my boyfriend's ex, Jessica, is part of the skateboard group and said I'm not allowed to go. Harvey said I can come skate one day with a smaller group a friends another day. I didn't ask any questions, and just said okay. It really hurt my feelings at the time, but I'm over it now. This was a week ago\n\nHarvey came into my store yesterday, and apologized for what happened. He felt really bad. Apparently the day they went to go skate, Jessica just talked shit about me the whole time, even though I've never even met her. Whatever, right? \n\nBut then Harvey told me that Jessica was talking about hanging out with my boyfriend recently. My stomach dropped. I didn't want to seem caught off guard so I didn't ask any questions. \n\nI'm not a psycho controlling bitch. If he would have just told me, I wouldn't have minded. Now it seems really sketchy that he's hanging out with her without without telling me. I don't think he would cheat on me, but I still feel uneasy about all this and don't know how to confront him.\n\nI'm mostly posting here because I'm not sure how to confront him. There's a good chance he will freak out on me if I say something, so I really need advice on how to approach this situation.",

He'll probably send a text every so often, but we usually go 4-5 days without talking. Whenever we do hang out it has to be convenient for him and it's not fair to me. He works at out former high school's garden and does yard work for people which I can understand takes up a lot of time, but then again I don't. Sometimes the one day I do get to hang out with him, he'll cancel if someone calls and I'll be left at dinner/movie theater/wherever alone.

I would be talking to him, and he would just nod his head and stare at his phone. \n\nI didn't want to bug him about it; I knew that he was happy about having a girlfriend and they seemed really good together.

He said no, but we haven't talked since. \n\nI did see him one more time after that over Christmas break at a game night a bunch of my friends were at, but he brought his girlfriend with him and he didn't even look at me. \n\nSince the majority of my friends have left for college, I've been incredibly lonely.

Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously \"managed\" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). \n\nMy question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have?

I initiated contact (I told her I didn't catch her name, because I was busy, and shook her hand and \"greeted\" her), I made her laugh, I suggested sushi to order (which she liked), I taught her how to use chop sticks (she said many have tried to, and she finally got the hang of it when I showed her. + a little more contact!), and helped her with a problem she was having at the moment (how to hook up a Nintendo through a VCR (text message)).\u00a0\n\nOverall, I think I did well.\n\nProblem is, how do I see her again? I've told the new girl that I thought she was very cute, which she responded with a slightly excited \"She's single!\" (which I guessed kind of strangely when she was talking about her new kitten to the new girl.)\u00a0\n\nSo, with my only channel of my coworker, how can I see her again to possibly ask her on a date without it being strange?",

Another pissed on it.\n\nThey made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May.

I brushed it off and went back to what I was doing.  \n2 hours later I climbed in bed and noticed her phone was still playing music.

I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!\n\nAnd I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart.

Are there people who are married and happy that had similar concerns about the person they're with?",

    "post": "So a bit of background and sorry for any typos this is on my phone. My girlfriend has been in track the past two seasons usually placing top 3 in her main event and top eight in the other two. Recently she has refused to do one of her side events due to an injury that is worsened by said event which I believe to be why the coach has done this.  \n\nSo on to the story, today at track everything goes as normal until about 30 minutes in when her coach calls her and about 5 other people in relationships over (side note: none of these peoples SO's including me distract at any sort of track practice or event.) and tells them they could be throwing and running so much better if they would stop \"exercising\" so much.  He asks if he needs to clarify and my girlfriend says \"yes what do you mean?\" Knowing exactly what he meant. He tells them then they need to stop having sex. My girlfriend walks away after this and he follows her and tells her he doesn't appreciate how she acted when she said that and is now considering not taking her to districts. My girlfriend listens to this then goes and begins to practice her event obviously upset until practice ends and I come and pick her up. \n\nMe and her both have no clue what to do and whether or not we should report him to the school. I'm just asking for advice on how to handle this situation.",

    "post": "Some background: I'm 22, f, 5'4\" and currently around 253 lbs. Over the last 3 weeks I've cut out soda and sweet tea completely, started eating more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and less white bread, reduced my calorie intake (down to 1390) started doing cardio at the gym (3 mph on the treadmill at an incline of 1, for about an hour, every day). Thanks to this, I've lost 15 lbs from my starting weight of 268.\n\nNow, I'd like to start strength training so that I'm not only losing fat but maintaining/building muscle so that when I finally do lose all this weight I won't just be a nasty, wrinkly mass of skin. I plan on strength training 3 times a week. \n\nWhile at the gym earlier today (last night?), I wrote a list of weight machines I should use and I just wanted to get peoples' opinions on my routine and if there are any other machines I should use or any muscle groups I neglected in selecting the machines. \n\nBEFORE anyone says I shouldn't use weight machines, I'd just like to say I'd prefer them because I'm uncomfortable using free weights and that's just that. When I'm more confident in my ability to keep form while lifting, I'll go to free weights, until then, I'd like to know that I'm not going to drop anything on myself or peel my muscles from my bones (I'm quite attached to them, you know!) because I didn't do something right.\n\nAnyways, here's my list of machines:\nLeg press\nHip abduction/adduction\nLower back (that's all the machine said)\nCompound row\nVertical chest press\nPullover\nOverhead",
    "summary": " I think I should use the above machines to target all of my muscle groups. Please let me know if I left something out and what MACHINE, if any, I can use to target that muscle/group. "

Since then we've been together at school nearly all the time, and hardly are ever apart.\n\nI really like her, but I can't tell if she likes me back. The texts she sends seem pretty flirty, she trolls me alot because I'm new and sort of almost makes fun of me in a joking way, and she also wanted to know about any of my past relationships. \n\nToday during lunch she walked off to talk to some of her friends, and I was just standing with another group of her girl friends. One of them told me \"there goes [name]\" and winked at me and laughed. I think it's pretty obvious that I like her, but I don't really know what her doing that meant. Also, another one of her friends said I should take her to homecoming and that we would make a \"really cute couple\".\n\nI just can't tell with her, and I really don't want to ask her and only be rejected and have our friendship ended. I really respect her and I don't want to put her on the spot like that.",

    "post": "How do I deal with my father's retaliatory BS? The details are below.\n\nWe've been estranged for over 3 years now - I disengaged to distance myself from him, due to two decades of his alcoholic behavior and emotional abuse that was directed toward me. I tried setting some boundaries, and his responses were late-night phone calls that made me feel harassed and threatened.\n\nI'm trying to give him what he wants - a relationship. But I am also making clear that any relationship will be on my terms, and that boundaries must be respected. I expressed this in a recent email - I won't talk to him on the phone because he gets immediately verbose and nasty when I suggest he did something that hurt me, or I assert myself - in his world, everyone he has a relationship with must act like they are his subordinate.\n\nI'm getting massive pushback via email. It's like he didn't even read where I stated that his behavior hurt my feelings and made me feel harrassed. Instead, I get a lot of \"well you did [x] to me and it hurt MY feelings! How could you do that to ME?\" \n\nI admit I've made a lot of mistakes with my father, I've said a lot of things out of anger, but he's had many years to bring these things up with me - he chooses to bring them up when I say how hurt I feel by his treatment, as if \"well you did it too\" somehow justifies everything.\n\nI know his responses are petty bullshit. Retaliatory. Makes me feel manipulated. But I'm not sure how to respond. I *DO* want to apologize for some of the things I've said in anger, but if I do, he goes into \"you screwed up and now you're going to lick my boots...see everybody screws up....let's forgive and forget\" mode, and I end up right where I began, not getting any acknowledgement about MY hurt feelings.\n\nHow do I respond to this? I feel like I'm in a lose-lose situation. I know I cannot change him, but being completely estranged is very painful.",
