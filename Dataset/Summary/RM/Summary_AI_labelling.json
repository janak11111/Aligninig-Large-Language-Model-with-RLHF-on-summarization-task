She told me she still loves me and cares about me, but right now she does not want to be together. She told me she is \"waiting for something to happen.\" yet she doesn't know what.\n\nShe says while we are broken up we should remain friends. We are partners on a group project for school that we need to work on together. We attend the same class of only 20 people every MWTh I understand I need to be courteous and professional along those lines, and that I want to be, but how do I deal with seeing her so often? I want to get back together with her, but at the same time I'm agitated about her basically stringing me along and not saying if we're really done or not.\nSummary 1 -  How do I act when I see my ex nearly daily, and what can I do to help my case for her to get back with me?\nSummary 2 -  Girlfriend broke up with me, I am confused about what to do next because she is seeing a councilor, and wants me to remain friends.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

First off, I apologize if this goes to the wrong subreddit.\n\nHere's the story: I started working at my current job a year ago. Since working there I've met some great people although most are significantly older than I am. There is one girl that I feel a great connection with. However, I've noticed that I'm not the only person who has some interest in her. Since working at this place, I've gathered that about 85% of the male employees gawk over her and would do anything for her. She isn't incredibly hot, her body isn't phenomenal, but she is naturally beautiful and has a wicked personality. She is one of the greatest and coolest people I've had the privilege of meeting. We speak and text frequently and there are things I know about her that no one else does; moreover, there has not been a time spent with her that I haven't enjoyed and that we haven't been laughing or smiling with each other. \n\nNow to the problems. 1) This girl is many years older than I am, there is over 10 years age difference between the two of us. Should I let this bother me? 2) She is technically still married. At the end of last September, she stopped wearing her wedding band and knew she no longer wanted to be with this guy, but they are still legally involved with each other. 3) Our working together may hinder any form of potential relationship and the increase in gossip (and there is already more than enough) would be harmful to anyone. \n\nI have attempted to ask her out but her schedule is limited, we still talk so it's not entirely awkward. \n\nUltimately, I am just unsure of what I should do. Should I be completely honest with her about how I feel and see where it goes? Or should I keep doing what I'm doing and let these emotions fester within my head and heart and potentially let the most amazing person I've met simply pass me by?\nSummary 1 -  Really like a woman with baggage 10 years older than me, not sure if I should sit by and let things happen, or be honest and completely open up to her and hope for the best.\nSummary 2 -  My girlfriend and I have a great working relationship but are unsure of how to proceed.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

We have been dating for about three months but have known each other for several years.  We originally went out a few times but the timing was bad, as he had just broken up with his fiancee at the time and was not emotionally ready for anything.  We became friends and recently rekindled this relationship.\n\nI am concerned that the timing is once again bad.  It took me several weeks to think of him as a potential romantic partner, and one night that finally clicked.  And I like him a lot, but I don't always feel fireworks.  I'm not sure if that's because I've known him for so long or it's a sign of how I feel about him.  Sometimes I feel like I like him a lot and I can imagine the potential, other times I feel more lukewarm, like I  could take him or leave him.\n\nIf I were to be with anyone long-term, it'd be him.  But if I'm honest with myself, I miss my single life.  And although it makes me sound really jerky, I guess I always thought, \"Oh, when I'm ready he'll be around.\"  Now this relationship has blossomed out of nowhere and I feel very overwhelmed with this pressure to make it work RIGHT NOW. Because not only is a relationship at stake - my deeply valued friendship with him is as well.  And if I screw it up now, I may never get that chance back.\n\nI guess my actual question is this - is it okay to continue this, knowing he is falling for me, when I'm not really sure what I want out of it?  I've been up front and honest with him, but I don't want to waste his time or break his heart, and I'm just constantly afraid that I might.  We're only two months in; I could easily develop very strong feelings for him and want that to happen down the road.  But I'm nowhere near that path right now.  He says that's okay, but I question that.\nSummary 1 -  I'm in a new relationship with my best friend and I'm confused about whether or not to continue on with it.  I feel like I don't know whether he likes me or not, and I don't know if I should continue to be his friend and go for it.\nSummary 2 -  I'm feeling unsure about wanting to stay in a long-term relationship.  Is it okay to wait and see if it's the right thing for me, knowing that I'm falling for him and that I may never get the chance to date him again?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

Me (F/27) and (M/36)When I first met him, he had just came out of a long term relationship with a woman he loved very much. She totally screwed him over and broke his heart. He was depressed and suffered stress related illnesses after the break up, sounding like he resented her leaving him. I called it off after 2 months of dating. During that time, she tried to get back with him and he decided against it after some confusion.\n\nWe began chatting again as friends and he was a different person, he seemed ready to make a go of things. However, I felt like he was still getting over her during our early days. Now it has been three years since we met and 2 1/2 since we became exclusive. He has told me he loved me twice when we first dated, when he was steaming drunk. I said it once during a crazy argument and we have both never said it sober.\n\nWe act crazy in love and he does everything a perfect partner would. Constant affection, great sex life, best friends, constantly together, live together, future plans etc etc. Best relationship I have ever been in and he says the same. If I bring up his relationship with his ex, he says he couldn't be himself with her and act silly like he can with me. He has no problems talking about growing old together and buying a big house together. But I can't help feel like this is messed up. We talk about everything under the sun including insecurities n relationship problems. Just not the L word..\n\nHelp!\nSummary 1 -  We started dating 3 years ago and are still together. I feel like he is still getting over his ex and acting silly and crazy with me. Do you think he is doing anything wrong with this?\nSummary 2 -  I am in a relationship with someone who has never told me he has ever said the L word while we are together. We act crazy together but I feel like this is messed up.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

She comes up for a few, I go down for a few. Just a couple days ago she let me know her work schedule was more free than usual (getting my hopes up), only to tell today that she wanted to skip on her visit here. It's no big deal, but it definitely dashed my hopes and made me a little sad (I'd already called for some time off from work just to see her).\n\nWanting to be direct with my feelings, I let her know that this made me feel down. But really, I don't want her to do anything that she doesn't want to. She hasn't had much time to herself and she absolutely deserves it. But after telling her this I feel like I was being passive aggressive. Granted, I'd much rather see her during this time, but I don't want to come off as controlling or demanding.\n\nShe reacted by offering to change her plans and come up, but I knew that's not what she wanted so I declined.\n\n(The matter of seeing each other is not the issue. The matter of sharing my feelings without being manipulative is.)\nSummary 1 -  Getting to know a new girl who's been gone for a week. Wanting to share my feelings and not have her do anything to make me feel like a pushover. Is it passive aggressive to approach her about this?\n\nThanks for any help.\nSummary 2 -  GF skipped on her visit to work, disappointing me.

My boyfriend and I have talked about it and we've agreed to a compromise that we both approved of, but I still get a bad taste in my mouth at the mention of him coming over. This is very upsetting to my boyfriend because he obviously really wants us to be friends. I want us to be friends, too, but I'm having a hard time with that right now. The worst part is that I'm not very good at hiding my emotions, so he's realized I'm not the biggest fan.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have talked things out again today and I realized I need to try harder and quit being a bitch. I had to meet my boyfriend and his friend half way. \n\nSo I'm trying to do damage control for how I acted and I feel pretty shitty about it now. How can I patch our friendship? How can I stop getting upset at him coming over?\nSummary 1 -  How can I fix my problems with my boyfriend's best friend?\nSummary 2 -  I'm having trouble getting along with my boyfriend's friend and I'm being a bitch to him. How can I stop getting upset about this?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

He is in his early 30's, has a good job, seems like a nice guy, isn't too shy when he is out amongst people. And I don't ever see him with other girls.\n\nWe hung out a bit. Not over doing it. Once a week maybe. Sometimes after a week or so. After a couple months we ended up doing it *bow chicka wow wow*. Right off the bat he was like...you should stay. I can't. I have kids and I get out a lot but I have to be home at the end of the night.\n\nA few times after that we went to a couple rock shows together, hung out at the bar. And over the last couple months I've gone to his house a couple times. And every time he wants me to stay, tells me he wants me to come over more, wants to hang out more...but then here is the deal.\n\nWe make plans to go do things...and 1/2 the time there is an excuse as to why he can't go out. He says, \"Get a hold of me tomorrow,\" and then all of a sudden he is sick. I even got ditched on Valentine's Day because his dad was in the hospital in a different state.\n\nHe'll never say...Why don't you come over. He just got back from vacation the night before and I invited myself over which I don't like to do and he said come over...but typically this isn't my style. Is this guy got some weird dick propaganda or does he want me to invite myself over?\n\nIt's fucking with me. Like what the hell do you want? You tell me you want to see me more but then there is always an excuse as to why he can't do something and doesn't invite me over.\nSummary 1 -  Guy is in a relationship with me and I like seeing him more but then he'll say he wants to go out and then he gets sick and I'm the one who has to go to the doctor.\nSummary 2 -  Guy says he wants to hang out more but always has an excuse as to why he can't.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

However I'm quite confused on this one.\n\nSo my girlfriend and her military friend (just finished basic) in Mississippi, go to see PANTyRAiD in New Orleans. Now the military guy wasn't given permission to leave base. My gf and the guy, drunk or whatever, cut some line in front of a guy, who doesn't care, but his fat girlfriend rages and punches my GF. They get into it, she says they both swing about 4 times, my gf lands a solid in her face and that's that. Everyone goes on partying, whatever, who cares.\n\n'Suddenly' a few minutes later, she is put in the back of a cop car by security, where the military guy already is (he wasn't even doing anything), and see the fat girl going on about how they the big black dude and the girl ganged up on her (and the boyfriend just nodding in agreement). \n\nCop drops them off at the hospital, says he believes my GF/friend in that they didn't do anything, but because she's claiming assault, they gotta go to court. He doesn't call the friend's military superiors, but he has to go to court too. \n\nBut the problem is my GF is flying back today, Mississippi is halfway across the country. She doesn't have the vacation to fly back, nor the money. I'm sure she can get a lawyer to represent her in absentia (that's what people do in these types of situations, right?) but that's a bit expensive and ridiculous...\n\nSo I don't know what this is. They weren't charged, they weren't arrested. What kind of court is this? They have to plead their case before a judge.\n\nMy guess is the fat girl won't even show up to court, but what is she supposed to do in this situation? \n\nThanks.\nSummary 1 -  My GF gets into a fight in New Orleans, gets arrested after some girl gets assaulted, and misses the flight back. What's the court process?\nSummary 2 -  Friend's girlfriend got into a fight in another state, she gets in some trouble and arrested by security, but just charges her with assault because she's claiming assault. \n\nedit: grammar\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

Did I do something wrong?Title pretty much sums it up but just for clarity I've been dating my girlfriend Erin for approximately 7 months officially and we we're dating for a month before that.\n\nBefore I met Erin I'd fooled around with my friend Amy (27F) a couple of times. We never slept together for various reasons but there had been a couple of drunken heavy petting sessions. This never went any further as she was only in the UK for work over the summer and moved back home shortly after.\n\n3 weeks after she left I met Erin. We met at a bar and she ended up coming back to my place (no sex just making out). We went on our first date a week later. It went pretty well! \n\nA few days after the date me and a few friends (mutual friends of mine and Amys) went to visit Amy in Amsterdam for a few days. This was a trip that had been planned before she left in the summer. This is where I end up fooling around with Amy again (more heavy petting still no sex).\n\nAfter returning home I continued to date Erin and stopped speaking to Amy. At the time I didn't feel like I needed to tell Erin about Amy since we'd only been on one date. A couple of weeks later I'd decided I really liked her and we became boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\nNow our relationship is getting more serious (talk of moving in in the summer) and what happened is all of a sudden on my mind. I feel guilty keeping this massive potentially relationship ruining secret from her. I have no idea how she'd react though it's not the nicest thing to hear regardless.

{"id": "t3_wnb7k", "title": "Girlfriend doesn't communicate! need help please", "post": "So this girl (21) and I (20), have been dating for about six months. Overall we have had a great relationship, we both trust each other, we have A LOT in common, we do almost everything together, and I do love her with all my heart. The problem is though, I am her first serious boyfriend and she doesn't know how to communicate. If I ask her something about us, or bring up something that has been bothering me, her immediate response is \"I don't know\", and she never wants or is willing to talk about it. \nFor instance, right now I am out of town for two weeks due to tonsil surgery, and she hasn't started a conversation once. She didn't even ask how I was doing after surgery, I had to call her. So when I brought this up to her last night, and asked what was going on, her response was \"I only miss you sometimes, and I don't know why I don't text you\". \nNow I have been as patient as possible with the whole thing, not pushing her to tell me things, trying to help her with how she can communicate with me.

We started dating when we were 19 and at the same university. We dated for 4 amazing years and were both very much in love. We had both completed our degrees and she found out she would have to move away (4 hour drive) to study her postgrad degree. We decided to stay together and try to visit each other as much as possible. After about 2 months of seeing each other once every two or three weeks it became obvious that it wasn't really working for either of us and she broke up with me, although it was amicable and I agreed with her reasons.\n\nWe were apart for 4 months but still seeing each other often enough because we move in the same circles. After 4 months we agreed that we were both miserable apart and wanted to be together and put more effort into traveling to see each other. \n\nThe two years after that have been amazing and I love her more than ever. I often think about us getting married and having kids and I know that she does too.\n\nSo this weekend she was planning on staying at uni because I had work all weekend. On friday night she turned up at my house and I thought she just wanted to give me a nice surprise. It turns out that she wanted to tell me that she cheated on me with a guy from her dorm 1 week before we broke up and that she couldn't hide it any longer because our relationship has been so good. She said she was really drunk and regretted it so much straight away and that she thinks it only happened because our relationship was on the rocks.\n\nSo the advice I'm looking for is: can a relationship ever be the same after someone cheats? She did break up with me the week after she cheated but just didn't tell me the truth about why.

I started my full-time career 3 years ago back in 2012 and worked at this Korean music management company for two years. I loved 70% of my job and I hated the rest of the 30% which involved a lot of bs and politics within the company that really overtook the good sides of the job. I was also being fed up with Kpop scenes so I ended up quitting the job early 2014.\n\nI left Korea right after I quit to try something else. I wasn't doing too well but I definitely enjoyed my time learning and seeing new things in music scenes of N. America. At the end of the day though I was always worried about my visa status and was thinking about leaving and going back to Korea at some point this year.\n\nThis January I got a phone call from my old boss and he offered a position with a raise and promotion. The company was doing a lot better than the time I left so I decided to take it without really trying to know where the company is at and how things are doing now, because I thought I knew the place.\n\nI packed everything early and rushed back here about a few weeks ago and started the job right away. It didn't take 2 days for me to figure out I absolutely hate the job. It's been slightly more than 2 weeks and I got reminded why I had quit in the first place. My boss had to convince a few executives to bring me back - for his convenience obviously -although everyone thought I did a great job before I left. I really don't see my future here, don't want to negotiate my terms because I don't see myself working with these guys long term.

Where do I go from here?We never talked a whole lot in class mostly because I was too shy, but last night he came to a get together at my friend's place and we both did the whole \"Oh hey, you're in my ____ class!\" We sat by each other and talked, had fun, drank. Then when my friend was leaving to take him and his friend home, he decided he wanted to stay with me. I sort of blacked out at this point, but I remember me sitting on a chair with my legs on his lap (we were still at my friend's apartment) and he was touching my legs. Next thing I know we're at my apartment making out in my bed. (I blacked out again)\n\nIt was going well I don't remember details but I asked if I could give him head and he said yes so I did, but it's pretty blurry to me and now that I think more about it, he may have seemed hesitant (it might just be in my mind though). I was talking to my friend on the phone this morning and she was saying that his friend was pretty drunk, but he said that this guy \"may or may not\" like me. I told her that I gave him head and she said that was a bad idea because he might just see me as someone who wants to get drunk and hookup without a relationship. According to his friend, he's not the type to just hookup with girls. I'm still trying to figure out if he does like me, we were all pretty drunk last night so maybe he didn't think anything of my decision to give him head, but I really don't want to mess this up. \n\nI woke up this morning and he was gone, but he left a note saying he needed to help his friend and \"here's my number\" with his name and number at the bottom. Although, accoring to my friend, his friend was fine when she dropped him off.\nSummary 1 -  I gave a guy head, he may not like me, how do I handle this?\nSummary 2 -  I gave a guy head and he may or may not like me.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

My life is crumbling around me. On one hand I finally got a job. On the other it pays only $7.25 an hour and we have bills. Massive bills. \n\nOur house is going to be foreclosed.  \nThe electricity is soon to be turned off. \nWe have a well so we don't pay for water but you need electricity to actually pump it out because it's like a Mile away from the house. \n\nI want to run away. I'm 21. I doubt anyone will look for me. I've been proactive, and constantly apply for other jobs. I also keep looking for affordable places. I've even checked HUD and other things. \n\nBut nothing is working out. I made a campaign to be honest. I need a vacation. I set up a FundMyTravel campaign to maybe escape all this. But so far only one person cares about me. \n\nI'm also in love. As stupid as I am I went and fell in love again. I don't deserve him. He's also unable to help. Hes got tons of student loans and just got in a car accident, so there goes THAT. \n\nI just need $1,000. All.the security deposits for thse apartments seem.to be that or higher. Even in other places I've looked in other states. Moving itself costs a lot. I've sold some of my.belongings on eBay but it isn't enough to make it work. \n\nI keep trying but the deadline is looming over me like a noose. I keep seeing other campaigns getting funded. 201%. 500% 3000%. I want to cry. I cant post on the charity Reddit or one for donations because I don't have enough karma. \n\nI've posted on Facebook, Tvtropes, my blog, Tumblr, and there's no one who can help. No one has money. And even though they don't have money, I always ask to share if they can't help me directly. But, out of the 50 people I've asked only 2 have done so. \n\nI'm sorry.\nSummary 1 -  I'm broke and I'm tired of living like this.\nSummary 2 -  I can't get my family out of this awful situation and I need money to move.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

My ass sweats nonstop.\n\nI mean **nonstop**.  Its gross.\n\n It is usually centered not around the crack but more north but still a few inches from the waistline. I notice it primarily when I am sitting down. I can sometimes see from the outside of my jeans where it is 'damp' (feel free to throw up now). And sometimes a condensation of sorts on the seat I was sitting on. \n\nI naturally sweat a lot but when this happens its not because I was tired or out of breath. Even when its cold out. Just sitting there doing nothing it'll happen without a doubt. Its worse when I have to use the restroom (1or2).\n\nDoes anything like this happen to any other redditors out there??\n\nEDIT: A fairly in shape 20 yr old male. 195lb 6'1\"\n\nEDIT: think if you are sitting on a chair with a 90* back.  If you sit with your back at a 15* angle from the back.

I have been broken up with this girl for about three years. I have been with another girl for two years. I am happy. I really am. Do you know that saying the one that got away. I would always text this one girl hey, or whats up. I knew she'd never respond, but that was okay. Just pretending she got it was okay. (On a side note I know this sounds stalkerish, but when we broke up as we have several times she said it was because she ran from deep commitment.) Now flash forward to a month ago.\n\nI was with my current girlfriend walking into my local Barnes and Noble book store. The person who was in front of me was her. I had no idea why she wasnt away at her school, but I knew it was her. I wanted so badly to say something say anything, but I didn't. I let her walk away. I talked to her over social media later, just exchanged pleasantries. Nothing more. I don't care if she forgets me. Its more I want to keep that relationship there, no matter how slight. I know I still love her. I kinda think I always will. When I think of growing old it is with her. At the end of the day if I could see only one face before I fall asleep it would be hers.\n\nWhat do I do reddit?\nSummary 1 -  I think I'm in love, but I am. I can't do anything about it. I don't know what to do.\nSummary 2 -  Broke up with girlfriend, wanted to tell her how I feel, but I was so focused on her I didn't. I'm not sure if I should tell her or not.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

Obviously I'm a nonsmoker, but they are basically chimneys. their smoking habit has gotten out of control. They smoke at lease 5 cigs or more everyday. And they refuse to do it outside.\n\nI've tried asking my friends multiple times to at least smoke out into the windows. but they don't even do that correctly, they hold the ciggerette inside and the very crudely blow out the windows. When I do try and tell them that they are still pretty much smoking inside, they get angry at me and stop smoking out the windows all together and start smoking inside again. \n\nThey are really my best friends that I have known for almost 10 years now. I don't want to start avoiding them because of this, but nor do I want to expose my self to any more smoke. every time I go see them I get a headache from the smoke, my clothes reek of smoke, and my stuff (phone, bag, wallet, etc) also end up reeking of smoke. I'm pretty sure I've inhaled so much smoke that I'm practically a smoker myself. I'm really sick of this but I don't know how to deal with their addiction. \n\nCan a smoker or former smoker who has experience in this tell me what to do?\nSummary 1 -  My friends won't stop smoking outside, I want to know how to deal with this.\nSummary 2 -  My best friends won't stop chain-smoking indoors around me.

I recently enrolled in my companies healthcare plan. After filling out the usual paperwork and selecting which tier of coverage I would like I was informed of a corresponding wellness program. At first I was excited about additional incentives but quickly learned that this program wasn't about encouragement and providing resources, it was about saving the company money by enforcing punitive measures for employees who don't meet certain healthcare goals.\n\nMore specifically a $25/pay period wellness surcharge and a $75/pay period tobacco use surcharge. In order to avoid the surcharges you must submit a Biometric Screening (weight, body fat composition, blood pressure, lipid panel, among other things) to HR as well as earn additional points by reaching target BMI, cholesterol levels, and even participating in telephonic or online \"health coaching sessions\".\n \nI'm a non smoker but admittedly a little over weight. Truthfully it's not an issue of being able to meet these goals but I don't feel like I should be required to share medical information with my employer that isn't relevant to my job responsibilities.\n\nl loosely understand how this type of thing can be enforced under the ACA but it seems to have some grey area regarding discriminatory actions under EEOC and ADA. \n\nI asked my employer if participation in the wellness program was mandatory and they informed me that if I wanted to enroll in the company healthcare plan that the wellness program was also required.\n\nIt may wind up being a moot point as I have another employement offer in the pipelines but I'm still really curious about what my rights are here and what courses of action I could pursue.\nSummary 1 -  Is the wellness program required to be approved by my employer? If not how do I go about contesting the mandatory requirements?\nSummary 2 -  My employer is attempting to enforce punitive wellness surcharges unless I submit a biometric screening and meet healthcare objectives. Participation is mandatory in order to enroll in their healthcare. Is this legal? What options might I have if I don't want to submit this information.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

Honeymoon phase has faded but i'm still so into him, even more so. I'm totally ready to exchange 'I love you's but I feel like he maybe isn't there yet. \n\nLately things have really changed between us. He is going through some pretty heavy family drama right now, and had a really abusive upbringing. He sees a therapist routinely which helps but has a very distracted and complex headspace. \n\nI'm still trying to understand his personality 100% because sometimes he is very difficult to read. He is not very forthcoming with telling me how he feels, both how into me he is or what's generally on his mind.  I am trying to coerce him to open up to me with what he is going through right now as he has definitely been pulling away. His response was pretty much, 'you just can't understand'. I want him to come to me for support when he's upset, not ice me out. \n\nI am really trying to be patient and understanding, but he is poor at replying to my messages, rarely asks me to hang out lately and small instances keep occurring where he is inconsiderate of what's going on with me while he is so distracted. I am constantly letting him know i'm there for him, how crazy I am about him.

Thoughts/experiences/comments/concerns?So I met this amazing girl at a coffee shop in Hawaii when I recently moved to another city.  I got her number and asked her out on a date because she is gorgeous.  We went and got to know each other, but I had to move back to NYC for a job.  We kept in touch and talked to each other almost every day.  There was nothing physical with her before.  I was quite hesitant because of how young she is.  We just aren't in the same places in our lives.  Anyway, after more time, I started to really like her for her personality instead of her looks.  I could also tell that she was falling for me.  \n\nAfter talking, we decided to meet up in Hawaii after a wedding I had to go to.  I got a hotel room and we spent 4 magical days together of filled with intimacy, lots of sex, and fun.  She lost her virginity to me during that time.  Not only that, but I'm the only guy that has seen her naked.  After all of this, I fell in love with her.  Pretty hard too.\n\nAll of this is pretty concerning now, because I have strong feelings about her, but I don't want to get hurt.  She basically told me she loves me and she wants to be with me, but I can't be the only guy that she's ever been with.  A lot of concerns are starting to come up now about starting a relationship with this girl.\nSummary 1 -  Met the girl of my dreams, she's very young, but I've fallen for her very hard.  She's very loving and kind, but I can't be the only guy that she's ever been with, and she may not want to date me because of that.\nSummary 2 -  The girl I'm seeing is very young.  I we are in love, but I'm not sure if I want to continue it due to age difference.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

Since then my depression made me tied to bed heavily and I parted my ways with those people.\n\nCurrently I moved to a new country to be with my boyfriend and my depression got a lot better. I find myself wanting to go out and do stuff with people but issue is I dont have many friends. My boyfriend and I had a friend who we would watch movies with every weekend but recently he started dating. Other friends we have are... Not into going out much.\n\nRecently we started playing video games a lot with my boyfriend's old group of friends. He used to hangout with them almost everyday but like me his depression parted his way with them. \n\nThey are cool guys and we thought we can be friends with them again and hangout in person. But we are so extremely shy and have social anxiety we dont know how to do that. Our entire interaction is based on this game we play. Sometimes I feel too anxious/shy/insecure to even speak up about the game, I have no idea to ask \"hey wanna do something\"\nSummary 1 -  How would you guys advice me on how to get over social anxiety and how to start hanging out with people again?\nSummary 2 -  Have anxiety, am extremely shy/insecure, and want to make friends with these people I am recently playing Video games with. No idea how to.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

Should i call off the wedding with my fiancee [25F]I met a very nice girl a 4 months ago and recently proposed to her and now we are engaged. I was one of those cynics who never thought i'd ever get married but i don't know what got into me and i did it anyway.\nRecently i met another girl and have fallen for her, my wishes to the contrary notwithstanding. She has strong feelings for me too. I have been trying to avoid meeting her but i can't stop thinking about her.\n\nThat i am already having these things does not bode well for the future. Maybe i was right all along - i am not the right person to ever get married.\n\nNow i have a choice between calling off the marriage which would be a very big deal what with both the families being involved now and wedding preprations (which is in a couple of months) and all the hurt it would cause, or going through with it but possibly being mildly unhappy for a long time, which would also be unfair to my future wife.\n\nI realize that it is completely my fault, but the only thing i am really concerned about right now is making the right decision for everyone. I really need some perspective on the situation.\nSummary 1 -  Don't know what to do about falling for a girl i met, need help.\nSummary 2 -  I am engaged but thinking of someone else. Should i call off the wedding?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

When I am comfortable with someone, I can be witty, funny, and I've even been told I 'talk like a poem'. However, when its with someone I just met, I for some reason cannot think of anything witty or stimulating to say.\n\nWhat are some mental tricks that help me get passed the 'stranger zone' and allow me to show my true colors? (Not just in relationships, but with making friends as well.) Any help will be appreciated.\nSummary 1 -  I can be a good boyfriend, but I struggle to find the right words for that. Help?**\nSummary 2 -  How to make sure I am not a 'stranger' when I get to know someone.\n\n\nThanks!\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1]}

How can I fix the situation?We just bought a new 47\" LED TV. We came home and found out our television stand is a little small for the new tv. So we decided to put it on a table temporarily so we can get a new TV stand tomorrow. \n\nMy sister is very energetic and jumps around the house, playing tag with her other sister etc. So usually they brake a few things. For example they broke our Samsung tablet yesterday. Anyway, I warned her about the TV and told her not to come anywhere near it until we bought a new stand. I told her she is clumsy and this is an expensive piece of electronics. I didn't think this could make her sad but it did. She cried for an hour. Now I feel like shit and I don't know how to deal with this situation. I tried to talk to her but she refused to talk and kicked me out of her room. I apologized but she didn't accept.\nSummary 1 -  Sister got a new tv without us knowing. I told her not to come near it until we buy a new stand. Sister got very sad. How do I get her to accept this?\nSummary 2 -  Made my sister cry because of a stupid TV and now she won't talk to me. Need advice.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

But I cannot stop fantasizing about the being bigger. Like, slightly more than my handful. I have had this type of fantasy my entire adult life. I don't like that I like it, but when I think about it, I get very, very turned on. It is just a fantasy.\n\nI love my girlfriend and I would never bring this up with her. I hate the idea of what that can do to a person. I have nothing to change about her. I am going to propose soon, too. I don't even support plastic surgery very much. I mean, in cases of reconstruction or it affecting somebody's life or their own personal decision, more power to them. I just think surgery is a large health burden and expensive, and not to be taken lightly.\n\nI guess I'm saying I think I should keep this fantasy a secret? Is it wrong for me to have this \"thing\"? Should I just ignore it forever? What should I do?\nSummary 1 -  I have a \"thing\" for breast implants. I want to keep it a secret from my gf. What should I do if I do?\nSummary 2 -  I have an unrealistic \"thing\" for breast implants but I would never want to even mention it to my girlfriend whom I love. How should I cope?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

Blaming myself, hating myself a bit, being far more combative and picking at things between us that I normally wouldn't. And combined with this depression, has just pushed him away. About 2 nights ago, on the way back from a baby shower which I was incredibly sad during (you know, the whole baby thing and all) I just pushed to talk in the car and it came to breaking up. And we did.\nIt was an incredibly emotional night between that and his car battery dying while we were talking. He says he has a hard time seeing a future with me and when I asked him what he saw for his future, his response was \"Nothing good.\"\n\nHere's the thing, when things were going well in the summer and I asked he saw a wonderful future with me. We were talking about moving in together to a nice little town close to his job, started looking at apartments.\n\nI'm a wreck, and understandably so is he. Since then, we have been in almost constant contact, talking about us, being sad and just random shit. I requested couples therapy and he said he is considering it, but isn't really sure. Even if he decides against it, I feel he needs to get some therapy anyway.\nSummary 1 -  Is it worth it to take this to couples therapy. It was asking for it.\n\nThanks for your time!\nSummary 2 -  Boyfriend and I broke up after having a baby. Now we are back together and are going about our lives. I'm having trouble seeing a future with him. How do I get past this?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

His roommate apparently broke up with the girlfriend I met months ago, but I had no idea until his roommate said he planned to dance with as many girls as possible on halloween and I replied \"what about your girlfriend!\" I have to pepper Eric with questions just find to find out that the party he went to over the weekend was his friend's birthday, what her name is, etc. A mutual friend of ours *died* a while ago and he didn't tell me for a couple days.\n\nPersonally I've always felt that, for better or worse, when you tell someone something you risk their SO hearing. In previous relationships my boyfriends and I would share gossip, annoyances, etc. with complete confidence that the information would stay within the confines of our relationship. It's totally understandable that he doesn't believe that and it's respectable that he's a good secret keeper but I feel... untrusted? I easily share minor things like a break up or someone moving cities with him, and he sometimes literally says, \"tell me gossip\", but I can never expect those things from him.\nSummary 1 -  My boyfriend refuses to share any gossip with me. It feels really weird, and I understand why he doesn't, but I feel like it's unfair.\nSummary 2 -  Boyfriend refuses to share gossip with me. Issue? If yes, how do I talk about it?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

I really like the couple and they have two great sons ages 7 and 12.\n\nYesterday, my girlfriend came over around 4ish after work.

She's wonderful and we compliment each other in a lot of ways, her family likes me and my family likes her and on the surface everything is hunky-dory.\n\nThe problem is we led (and still lead, though since we do a lot of stuff together it has converged slightly) very different lifestyles. She likes being in bed by 11 and waking up early to go run. I will beat the night into submission and sleep till noon. I love doing drugs (no habits though - quit smoking last year) and she's okay with my use but has never done anything besides drink a little and has little to no interest in exploring further. Blowjobs are also painfully absent - she just isn't as enthusiastic about them to make them sexy, and as a result I'm not as into it and so she doesn't like them. I thought I would be okay with this as we have lots of sex but now I really miss them.\n\nFinally I know that I'm not ready to settle down in any sense - I'm not ready to not be single again, and knowing this makes it feel like I'm being disingenuous to myself and to her continuing the relationship like this. I love her and I want to not hurt her and a lot of things that I feel like I'm complaining about feel selfish, but I just don't think I'm ready as a person to really give her the relationship she deserves.\nSummary 1 -  Having trouble giving a girl the emotional support and affection she deserves.\nSummary 2 -  I don't think I'm ready to be single again and I don't want to hurt her by being unhappy.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [2]}

We live together since 2 years. Everything is very nice, we get along very well, make each other laugh, have good sex and almost never fight.\n\nWe have seriously talked about having kids together, and are planning trips together. So far so good.\n\nHowever, sometimes I feel he still has feelings, or cares for his ex fling. They are in the same older group of friends and see each other sometimes on parties (lets say once every 6 months). \n\nI dont know her very well, and I do not know their exact history. Just that they were friends with befits for a while and then she got into a serious relationship with someone. After a while I met my boyfriend and we got together.\n\nThis girl apparently is in a difficult relationship and her current boyfriend does not treat her well. After parties when my bf run into her and spoke to her he told me what a horrible guy her bf is and that she deserves better. This is very noble of him, and I agree. \n\nBut sometimes I feel he cares for her too much. I understand that they are friends and that they see each other from time to time on parties, but I can not shake the feeling that if she were single he would want to be with her. I am also unsure why things did not work out for them in the first place. It makes me insecure and uncomfortable about their friendship.\n\nI do not want to feel this way, and be the bitchy girlfriend. i want him to be able to hang out with this group of friends and also be friends with this woman. I am afraid to talk to him about my feelings, because I feel they are very childish. But somewhere inside I think- If he was not with me, or if she becomes single, he would like to give things a shot between them. Am I being childish or is there sincere reason to be concerned?\nSummary 1 -  my bf has been friends with a girl since long before we were dating. I am scared that he still cares for her. How do I resolve this?\nSummary 2 -  I am confused about my boyfriend's feelings for his ex.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

He confronted her about it (he read her text messages as she received them while she was in the shower) and she admitted it, but had to go to work. She's there now and he is at home all alone wondering what the hell to do.\n\nHe is going to break up with her. She is going to fight it and try to get them to stay together. He is going to give her a week to get out of their apartment, will help her pack everything and be civil enough, but then she's on her own.\n\nThey had to move about 8 hours from home for his job, so once she leaves, he will be completely alone. He hasn't made friends because he's been so busy with school and his new job. I told him to take off work and come spend time with me, but his job requires him to be there, and mine requires me to be here, eight hours away from each other (driving distance). I would take a plane down to see him next weekend but the airfare is about $400, which I don't have. I'm thinking of just spreading it across a few credit cards....idk. He may be able to come back up for more than one day for Christmas now that she's not holding him back, but that still leaves 3-4 weeks before he could be with us.\n\nAnyway, I guess what I'm looking for here is just some advice about all of it. What can I say to him to ease his pain? How can I make sure I'm doing everything to be there for him when he is so far away? Thanks in advance to anyone who has some kind words. He deserves the absolute best, I love him so much, and I can't believe she would do this. It's something I never would have expected.\nSummary 1 -  Brother found out that his girlfriend has been cheating on him for a few months and is going to break up with her, how can I help?\nSummary 2 -  My brother is getting dumped and I don't know what to say to ease his pain.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I will never see her again.I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I read the rules and didn't see anything wrong with this.\n\nStory time: In March 2013 I met a girl at a speech (high school public speaking activity) meet, and we instantly connected. I'm a confident guy, but I'd never been too interested in women until her. We'll call her Anna. We talked for hours daily, and I soon asked her on a date. We talked a lot and hung out as much as possible (We both worked, so it was sort of difficult).\n\n   Then, she graduated. I'm two grades under her, so I knew it'd be kind of difficult to maintain, but not like this. She decided to go to a school several states away, which was a bit of a blow. My parents then announced that our family was also relocating to a different state, even further away from Anna. We hung out less and less, by the end it was only an awkward friendship. I deleted Anna on Facebook in an idiotic fit of rage. We haven't talked in months. I'm certain she doesn't want to speak to me. She was dating a 25 year old for a while, but I think they've split. \n I miss her. She never goes back to our home state to visit due to a poor family life. She loves her new state and school.  I hadn't thought about her in a long time, but the last couple weeks have been filled with thoughts of Anna. It's so obvious now that she was great, and I should've made more time for her. Knowing that I'll likely never see her again is the worst feeling I've known. Mods, I'm sorry if this shouldn't be here. I know reddit isn't too fond of teens.\n\nEDIT: For wall of text.\nSummary 1 -  Girl and I had instant sparks. We both left the state, and I may never see her again.\nSummary 2 -  I can't stop thinking about the first girl I loved.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I actually met her for 30 seconds before they moved on and later I messaged her, got her number yada yada and now we text and snapchat on a semi regular basis.\n\nI'm really confused because I've asked her on a breakfast date where she initially said yes, only to cancel later saying she had shit to do with her mom without making alternative arrangements. When we text, there's times where she just stops replying completely but then sends me snapchats the next day. When we first talked, she complained about her ex a lot when they dated back in February to the point where I had to confront her about me not being her emotional tampon and how I didn't want her to get too comfortable with me despite not knowing each other pretty much. At that point my motivation was pretty low, and I ceased to text her for a month.\n\nRecently after a month of not texting, she texted me first saying hey and asking me how I was doing and we talked a bit about how we were preparing for school. She actually explicitly asked me that we should both get a coffee together at school and I expedited it by suggesting that we should go to our university's kickoff game. She said yes and that it'd be a new thing for her to try but later that night, she said she couldn't go because she had to work an on call shift. (She's a high school tutor so it's busy season now). I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions? My friend says this girl is leading me on and using me for attention and once she gets her fix she bails.\n\nThanks Reddit!\nSummary 1 -  How do I break up with a girl and proceed from there?\nSummary 2 -  Been talking to a girl for 30 seconds before our first conversation, but she has no intentions of really communicating with me. What can I do?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}

Any tips, tricks or advice?Hey /r/relationships! Have loved this subreddit for awhile and finally have something to ask!\n\nI've been with R for just under 2 years and she's a smoker (4-5 smokes a day) that's gearing up for a big quit next week. She's got the patch, has a really well laid out plan and I want to be part of TEAM R in helping her kick it for good. One of the things she asked me for is some little bonuses or incentives for being quit 1 week, 1 month, 6 months.\n\nLooking for general advice, support, ideas to help her and also great ideas for fun/cute incentives. We live in Canada, love camping, she's a candy-fiend and she's also into live music for a few background tidbits.\nSummary 1 -  GF wants to quit smoking soon, what do I do to make her happy?\nSummary 2 -  My gf is quitting next week, has a good plan and I want to be a little more supportive/helpful.\n\nThanks so much for any input!\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

Just to give you some background info on what he looks like, he's about 68 (I'm only 16), big pot belly, also missing all his teeth.\nNow before you start flaming at me, saying that I must be some degenerate POS kid for not being proud of my father, let me just say he has been a terrible father figure. This question is already starting to get long, so can't explain all that right now. He's always embarrassing me. I go to a school where it's one really big classroom with all the kids in there, and the teachers/principal are in the same room too.\nToday, he waltzed right in there while it was quiet and everyone was taking a test, and starts yelling and making a scene with the principal about why the work isn't hard enough for me, etc..the kids were staring and laughing, it was very embarrassing. Not the first time he's done this sort of stuff either. For one, I look nothing like him, people say this all the time.\nSummary 1 -  Dad makes big scene in front of whole school, the teacher calls him by [My name]'s father, so everyone knows he's my dad. How do I explain to people he's not my dad? I want to say he adopted me but how would I explain this? I wish I could say I'm making this up but I'm not, please help, I'm now being teased/bullied for this.\nSummary 2 -  My dad is a douche.

I know it sounds crazy just give me a minute of your time.A little back story here and I'll apologize now I'm on a mobile. I bought a house when I was a freshman in college with all my high school savings. My payments was around $700 a month plus bills, it's a 4 bedroom house so I took roommates and they paid around $350 a month. \nEarly into my freshman year I met a guy called Brad he lived with me for 4 years paid rent mostly on time every month which was nice. The downside this dude pranked and jacked with my stuff and pretty much made me hate the idea of a roommate forever. Flash forward 4 years I have a job that can easily pay my mortgage and bills and pretty much whatever else I need. One of Bs old friends needs a place to stay I repeatedly said no due to he was a large part of the pranks and messing with me during those 4 years. I eventually cave and let him move in after he swears he won't fuck with me at all. Now 3 months ago we started playing fantasy football no money on the line but it's still really competitive.  I begin to win more and more pushing B and new roommate down in the standings. Since new roommate is the creator of the leauge he has pretty much full control over everything which he also gives to B. This week as I am winning my 4th straight game they drop all the players from my lineup which really really pisses me off. I ask them for 2 hours to please fix it back they refuse. Here I know I am in the wrong but I text new roommate he needs to find a new place to live as he had pissed me off and I don't want him around. I gave him plenty of time to find a place and leave. On a scale of 1 to 10 how in the wrong am I ?\nSummary 1 -  roommate has pissed me off over fantasy football and I no longer want to allow him to live in my home.\nSummary 2 -  Fucked with roommate over dog fighting and he deliberately fucked with my stuff and shit on me to keep me from going into debt.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

I don't really have a problem with this at all, but lately I've been getting the vibe that maybe he's just not that in to me anymore. \n\nI know the solution is to talk to him about it, but I don't know how to bring it up with out making it sound like I have a problem with how we are now, or sounding overly paranoid if I'm wrong.\nSummary 1 -  my boyfriend seems to be less interested in us and I'm not sure how to bring this up or how to approach him about it.\nSummary 2 -  How do I bring up that I think my boyfriend is losing interest in me?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

I have a MA degree in a completely unrelated field than higher ed and frankly, \"advisor\" is a very specific job and there aren't THAT many openings, making them competitive. I also do program coordination, meetings with partners, handling a large CRM, pulling data, work with excel, give presentations, etc. So, it's not like I only have experience helping students. I'm very smart and hard working, but because there aren't many jobs in my field-- I'm scared of leaving the job I love for something i have no clue what will offer. Will there be anything for me? Will I have to take a job below my intelligence and settle?\n\nIn my opinion, do you think I'm over worrying and that people would hire me, even if it isn't directly in my field? I'll have a little over a year experience when I apply. Secondly, would you move or stay? Yes, I'm certain this man is for me and he is very serious about us as well.\nSummary 1 -  My boyfriend is applying all over for jobs and I may have to move for him despite liking my current job. Will this be a horrible move for me? Looking for feedback/opinions.\nSummary 2 -  I'm a remote advisor for a university in a higher education company and my boyfriend is in a PhD program in a different city from me. My current job is very competitive and I'm afraid I'll be left with nowhere to move. Is there any hope for me?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

Now I get a TimeWarner RoadRunner branded search results page ( whenever I type in something that doesn't directly resolve and this irritates the fuck out of me. It occurs across multiple browsers on multiple systems running multiple OS.  I spoke with 3 different support reps today and they all had no clue what the hell I was going on about. \n\nIf I stop using their DNS the problem goes away, but I'm skeptical of public DNS and just want to use the DNS I am paying for.\n\nAm I going insane or are they doing this to me? I swear it was all good just a week ago and I have been using RR for years.\nSummary 1 -  DNS is broken. Has anyone else experienced this?

We're very much in love and get along great but I keep having some tough feelings regarding her being Bi. She told me early on that she is Bi but didnt go into it saying shes not very comfortable discussing it. A large portion of her circle of friends are lesbians, that I get along with pretty well. But several times on nights I'm working they plan nights out together at lesbian clubs. I'll see photos from these nights of her dancing and grinding on other girls. I feel like she still desires female attention. Also in the bedroom she hardly ever goes down on me even though I give her oral every single time we have sex.  It can be a very uneasy feeling at times as I have no experience with a Bi SO. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated.\nSummary 1 -  Girlfriend is bi, but isnt very comfortable talking about it.\nSummary 2 -  My Bisexual GF of nearly a year spends a lot of time hanging out and partying in lesbian clubs with other women and it makes me uneasy.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

He is just entirely oblivious to his own piles of mail, laundry, dishes, ect (He's not a slob, just cluttered). This is mostly because I clean up after him (which I don't mind doing, I work half as much as he does). Yet, if I leave something out becuase I'm busy, he immediately notices it and accuses me of being messy and points out that he doesn't have any mess.... \n\nI just came home after being gone for 9 days and the place is pretty messy. I plan to clean it up, but before I do, I was thinking about taking pictures and showing him later that he is in fact messy. \n\nIt's not a huge point of contention for us or anything, I know reddit likes to jump on the \"LEAVE HIM NOW\" bandwagon, but this really isn't a big deal- just comes up every once in a while. Would it be tacky or petty of me to do this to him? Or is it perfectly reasonable? I don't want to make him feel bad, I'd just like the respect I feel like I'm due for being the non-messy one.\nSummary 1 -  Would it be tacky to take pictures of husbands mess to prove to him that I'm not the messy one?\nSummary 2 -  I am taking pictures of my husbands mess if he's not willing to admit it.

It would be a good jump for me as I'm getting ready to transfer to a 4 year soon  ( a year roughly) and I would have the option to transfer. After filling out all my paper work I realized I filled out a previous employer verification ect. Well, I am starting to stress a little. I feel I have done a good job. I go in 4/5 times they ask me to go in (when I'm not scheduled). I usually stay after my scheduled time if Im asked to. Lastly, I make deliveries (even though when I started I was told all i needed to do was X and Y, not Z. Z being deliveries) whenever I'm asked to. Its a family run business and I do my best to be flexible with their schedules.

First off, got into a decent university and was accepted into their Aerospace Engineering Major. Started to do bad in physics, got Academic Probation because having mediocre grades (B-C) and an F (or 2, yeah Physics\u2026) can really hurt. Dropped into Undeclared Engineering because of my belief that I wasn\u2019t all that bad (big mistake) and could still make it. \n\nCome summer, my grades were still relatively shit (GPA at 2.25, average for engineer student: 2.75). Took some time and asked my friends what they would do in my shoes (which was extremely hard, as they are all smart and I didn\u2019t want to be looked down upon\u2026stupid pride), and finally decided, enough is enough. Switched out to Business Economics and now my Major GPA is relatively high but my overall is still a lovely 2.2 (Only my single variable calculus class was counted into my Major GPA)\n\nMy question is this, to all you people who look at resumes, if I were to send my Major GPA, would you then ask to see my overall GPA? Or is there not even an option to show your Major GPA and you automatically have to send in what your overall is? \n\nAlso, I know that for the most part a lot of people have been telling me to not worry as much, because if I get an internship then for some strange reason, I\u2019ll magically be fine. But then my question is, a lot of internships ask for your GPA, what do you do in that case? (Submit overall or major?)\nSummary 1 -  Major GPA is important to most people, should I send in my overall GPA or my major GPA?\nSummary 2 -  What do you do in the case that you need to show your Overall GPA, and are unsure how to do so?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1, 0]}

I've started randomly bleeding between periods about 1.5 years ago.

Since about year ago, it's gotten progressively worse to wear I'm bleeding in between every period. I've had SO many tests done and they've all come back negative. The tests I've had: two pap smears (Thinprep), colposcopy with three cervical biopsies, endocervical curretage, STD tests, cryotherapy (my doctor thought it would help with the bleeding), endometrial biopsy, d&c with hysteroscopy and polyp removal (biopsy was done on tissue). I thought the d&c would fix my problem, since it removes the uterine lining, but apparently that only helped a little. I'm still bleeding, though not as much.\nI've been to multiple doctors and they only thing they've found are three uterine polyps and my uterine lining was thick.

(26m/26f)My girlfriend and I have been together for coming up on a year now. I love her and she is amazing all around, I can honestly see her as being the one, however, there is one area that just doesn't connect us. We do tasks together, such as eat dinner, shower, go to the grocery store, and that's really it. Other than that, talking about our days, planning future career steps, and sex (which occurs less and less because we argue since I primarily don't feel any bond or connection), we do nothing together.\n\nShe loves watching TV shows, that's her thing. I hate watching TV, the only TV I can watch is sports and game shows. Whenever we watch a TV show, I get bored, and often times my body just naturally starts falling asleep, especially if we do this at night. Doesn't matter how much I like or dislike the show. She wants us to do that more, and I hate that because to me, it's no connection sitting in silence and staring at a TV.\n\nHer hobbies are TV and horse riding. She also works a very intense job that keeps her busy a lot. My main hobbies are videogames and the gym, but I like watching sports, wasting time on the internet, riding my motorcycle, etc. So there is no overlap. Sometimes on weekends we go out in the front yard and play soccer, which we both enjoy. Her philosophy is that she doesn't want to \"spread herself too thin\" so that she can excel at her career and hobbies. My philosophy is if I like it, I'll do it no matter how good or bad I am at it.\n\nHer main complaint is that I can't just \"hang out\", i always have to plan that we will watch TV, plan that I'll play games with friends online, etc. I can't just go with the flow. To me there is very little flow if our only activity is TV. I love her but I feel so disconnected, especially when we watch TV. What do we do?\nSummary 1 -  I love my girlfriend, but I feel so disconnected from her, which is why I don't enjoy spending time with her.**\nSummary 2 -  GF and I don't connect with our hobbies, how do we connect?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0, 1]}

She is highly religious and believes that God is the solution to all of our problems. \n\nWhenever I try to talk to her about my emotions, she does one of two things. First, she will give me some theological answer while failing to actually talk to me about how I feel and understand me better. Second, she will get really pissed off at me for not trusting her and her commitment to change.\n\nFor instance, I just tried to talk to her about my insecurities surrounding our relationship, and she got really angry at me for not trusting in her promise to stick with me.

{"id": "t3_3abq5u", "title": "Me [20 M] with my upstairs neighbours of two years duration, their dog is peeing on the balcony and it drips onto mine.", "post": "Hey there Reddit,\n\nHere's the deal. I've been living in an apartment for a about a year now. For the last 2 months or so, my upstairs neighbours (who I've never met) have had a dog living with them who occasionally goes outside onto their balcony (directly above mine) and pees. Our balcony floors are wooden slats, so some of it drips though onto mine.\n\nI'm not sure if it happens all the time because I work full time, but I think it might because sometimes I come home and their are very small puddles of liquid (which I'd presumed to be water) on my balcony, even if it hasn't rained. This being the case I think that they may have trained the dog to pee outside without really considering (or caring) that they've essentially trained their dog to pee on me.\n\nObviously this is not the greatest of situations, and I want to send them a note or contact them in some way so that it can stop.

Don't know if it is cheating.So today in the morning I clicked on my gf's phone to check the time and saw a text from someone she used to hook up with.  Usually wouldn't care, but text said something along the lines of \"hope you liked my snapchat ;) ;)\"  I was curious, and even though I shouldn't have looked at their conversation.  Leading up to his text he brought up his penis and although she said hey now calm down I have a bf, she still flirted and complimented his penis.  Then said we just have to be freinds if anything.  I didn't see the snapchat, but she had yet to respond to his snapchat text although she did open the snap I guess yesterday.  If it was something sexual like I suspect, she should have definitely texted him when she opened it that that was not OK and that they could no longer be friends if that was what he wanted.  She didn't do that, just left it blank.  That is what worries me, because I know my gf is fairly attractive and is going to get hit on, but I need to know that she'll set boundaries and let ppl know whats not ok.  I'm planning to bring it up to her tonight, by just asking her to see her phone and asking her why she felt the need to have this conversation (especially the flirting and the complimenting) b/c she should not have led him on at all, she should've stopped it when it became sexual.  I'm planning to prefacing by letting her know that I'm not proud that I checked her phone, but was also really thrown off by the text, and would understand if this is the end of the relationship.  I don't know if that is to dramatic, what do y'all think? Am I in the right for bringing it up or should i let it go?\n\nThanks fellow redditors.\nThrowaaway account\nSummary 1 -  Asked gf to see her phone and figure out if she flirted with someone, she did, I didn't see it, she flirted back.  She did open the snapchat, should she tell him?\nSummary 2 -  asked gf to check her phone when she flirted with guy.  not sure if she did it because she was sexually excited, or to throw a guy over to her side and make him jealous.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I don't care if he's bisexual, but if he's dating me he shouldn't be kissing anybody else regardless of gender, but he doesn't see it that way. He described it as \"lad bantz\".\n\nI also have a problem with his best friend- 17F- her and I have never got on, and he told me that whenever he's friends with her he can't help but really like her (they weren't really talking when he told me this) and they have a history together- not sure exactly what as he won't elaborate. I don't mind him being best friends with a girl, as my best friend is a boy so it would be hypocritical. I'm more worried about the comment he made and the fact that he's really secretive about when he's spending time with her, to the point where he lies to me about it and I find out through other people.\n\nWhen I told him how I feel about their friendship- not looking for him to choose between us, I just wanted to be open about how I felt- he basically told me that I was being irrational and stupid. \n\nHe also told me that when we have sex he thinks about other girls and I would have also thought that was nothing if it wasn't for the way he was acting when he told me that, like it was a really big secret and a big deal.\nSummary 1 -  My boyfriend kissed another man in front of me and I'm worried that he'll tell me what he did and I'll think he's lying about it. What do I do?\nSummary 2 -  My boyfriend don't seem to be interested in that bdsm lifestyle, don't know how to handle it.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I need advice on whether or not I should let him know.So I had a discussion with my Dad about some political (I guess that's the word) topics. We talked about church/state, racism, immigration prejudice, and sexism. General 'equality' stuff. We didn't see eye to eye at all. That would be fine, you can't expect everyone to agree with you, but the arguments that he was making were often 'you're 20 and acting like a 20 year old, which is fine' and 'you don't have enough life experience. You don't know. You'll change your mind when you're older'.\n\nWell I'm not ok with that attitude. Yeah I'm in my 20s but that shouldn't invalidate my opinion and it certainly doesn't mean that I'm inherently wrong or uninformed. I identify very strongly with my political views. They're a very important part of me. And yes my views may very well change in the next ten years, but that's because people are fluid and opinions can change. That doesn't belittle my opinions NOW. Or it shouldn't I don't think.\n\nI'm just really bothered by this and I'm wondering if it would be an ok idea to approach him and mention how I feel. I would like for him to respect my opinion in the same way that I do his. Should I just let it go? It's really bothering me.\nSummary 1 -  I have political views that my Dad doesn't agree with. I'm confused on how to approach this...\nSummary 2 -  My Dad may be a hypocrite. How should I approach him about it?**\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

It is taking over my life, and due to the practices and physical training sessions, it is withholding me from doing something I actually enjoy- the rowing team. When I called my parents and told them I want to drop, the were extrememly displeased, saying they were relying on the money and think that I haven't given it enough time, and even went as far as threatening to pull me out of college. I don't actually think they will do that though. I realize that it hasn't been a very long amount of time, but the deadline to drop classes is coming up soon and I need to make a decision by then. Am I old enough now to choose what I do in life? Am I right to drop something that I hate, instead of force myself through it? I really need some help, considering I'm a freshman and really have no one to talk to about this.\nSummary 1 -  I hate ROTC, but I need to make a decision on what to do with my life.\nSummary 2 -  I don't like ROTC, and my parents are being very strict. I have a deadline to drop my classes, but I don't want to, and I need some advice.\n\nEDIT- Thanks for the advice! I didn't come here to ask for help, I came here to ask for advice.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}

Got depressed by what I read about meMy GF and I have been living together for almost a year now. I'm happy, and until a few hours ago I had no reason to believe she wasn't happy as well. We've always encouraged having an open dialogue, and lately she hasn't let me know of anything about our relationship that needs fixing.\n\nNow, some of my biggest insecurities have always been that I don't have a ton of friends, and that I don't take a lot of initiatives. That I'm \"boring\" and \"safe\". Bit of an introvert, really.\n\nI do enjoy going out for drinks every now and then, and I never say no to any social event if I can help it. But nearly my entire social circle were friends with my GF before we even met. I had very little \"new\" to offer her in that regard.\n\nOn to my reading her diary. Yes, I know it was wrong, but what's done is done. I was skimming the last few pages looking for my name, and when I saw it, my heart sank.\n\nThis is how it read: \"Feeling so distanced from OP right now. Lonely, even. I'm in love with him, but maybe that's not enough? Maybe we won't make eachother happy? Maybe I should look for someone who helps me step outside my comfort zones more?\"\n\nBasically confirming my fears. To retiterate, I've never said \"no\" to any exciting event with her ever (because I'm so self conscious about being perceived as boring). But I haven't taken a lot of initiatives either.\n\nMy question to you is: where do I go from here?\n\nCan I ever get it out of my head that I'm not her first choice? Is her mentioning \"*looking for someone else*\" (albeit not actively) a dealbreaker?\nSummary 1 -  I [27 M] read my GF's [26 F] diary. Got depressed by what I read about me.**\nSummary 2 -  GF has negative feelings towards me that she's not communicating. Is this relationship a disaster waiting to happen, or is it salvageable?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

So I hid my magic deck in my sock drawer and would claim to \"visit family\" on the weekends I went to tournaments.\n\nThen comes spring break, when my rommate and I are packing our things, and he sees me quickly move my magic cards into my bookbag and starts laughing. \n\nEmbarrassed, I didn't know what to say so I just turned a very bright shade of red. His response: he pulled out his deck from its hiding place in his drawer and asked to play.\n\nWe locked the common room door to keep some privacy, but inevitably that brought more attention to the situation and we were outed. In retrospect, that was one of the silliest secrets I've ever tried to keep.\n\nFor those of you in the know, I had rdw post-extended-dual-rotation (scrolls, jackal pups, ports. blistering firecat was the new thing)\n\nHe had a \"secret force\" deck (natural order into verdant force).\nSummary 1 -  I tried to fit in by hiding my magic deck in my sock drawer and then hid two other decks in my bookbag.**\n\n*edit*: formatting\nSummary 2 -  I hid my magic cards in my sock drawer, as did my college roommate. He caught me packing for spring break, and we both discovered we were hiding the same thing.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}

As of recently, we've been friends. We hang out, sleep together, in my eyes it feels like we are more than friends. To my SO, it's strictly friendship. I want more than friendship and even though he tells me he only wants friendship, he acts as if he is in a relationship. He is affectionate, kisses me, takes me on dates, buys me flowers, etc. It's confusing to me. I feel that his actions speak louder than his words. What he tells me doesn't match his behavior. Sometimes I feel as if it annoys him that he likes me and doesn't want to admit he loves me. He has a hard time expressing how he feels so I try not to hold it against him. But why fight how you feel about someone? I'm not sure why it bothers him that he loves me. I've asked him before and he never really gives an answer. \n\nI'm at a point that I'm ready to be committed to someone and I would like it to be him. I don't know if I should wait or move on and find someone who wants what I want. It's hard for me to walk away because I feel invested in our relationship, whether it be as friends or more than that. I love him a lot and we get along very well. We enjoy a lot of the same things and we always seem to be laughing and having a good time. I think he is worth the wait, but it isn't easy. \n\nAnyone ever been in this situation? Do you wait or do you walk away? I don't want to make a mistake and miss out on something awesome.\nSummary 1 -  I (25f) don't know if I should stay or leave my SO (25m)\nSummary 2 -  should I wait around for my SO to want what I want, or should I move on without him.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}

But she primarily wants to go for the food in Thailand but I've already been to Thailand.What's the compromise? I want to go to the Phillipines I think. I like nature; Snorkelling, Swimming, Kayaking, Waterfalls, Rivers, Fishing, Wildlife, natural wonders. I like markets, local foods, local culture, night life, dancing, music, shopping as well. I'm not on a long trip though, so culture wise I'm not looking to properly deeply immerse myself in the culture and spend the whole time working on a family farm or anything like that.\n\nSo, what do you guys reckon?\n\nI've got friends in Singapore and HK. I'm tempted to bookend a 10 day stay somewhere adventurous with a a few days city break at each of those places.\n\nI'm a relatively experienced traveller, but my girlfriend is not. She's an experienced tourist though. But she is a bit fussy. So I can't go anywhere too off the beaten path or she will flip her shit.\nSummary 1 -  Will my GF enjoy the food in Phillipines if she likes Thai food? If not, where can I take here that is comparable food wise but somewhere new for me? And baring in mind what my interests outlined above are, where would you recommend for me?\nSummary 2 -  I want to go to Asia next year. But GF wants to go to Thailand. I'm not too keen on this idea. But I'm interested in the culture and nature as well as the markets and shopping in those countries. I'm a bit fussy but she's not. How do I balance this?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I never thought like this before but this has been going on for the past several months and I just need to figure all of this out. \n\nI am kind of worried that \"John\" will be upset but not really because he is really chill and I think would be cool with it. The real problem is 1. I have no idea even what to do and 2. my SO and \"John's\" sister are kind of friends.\nSummary 1 -  I am dating a girl that has a sister that is really attractive and I have a crush on her.\nSummary 2 -  I have a pretty big crush on my best friends little sister and she is friends with my girlfriend.

We just decided to go on a date Friday.Me and my best friend, \n\nfor the sake of this I'll call her amy, have been at an unclear state for months. When we first met, it was for a date. She had recently been dumped by someone she thought was the one, but even despite that, We clicked extremely well, and I have never felt that way, before or since. Her family is like my family now and I love them all. In the weeks that past, Amy told me she valued our friendship too much date me. People told me she was still hurt and to give her time. We recently decided that since we both needed a place to live, and our jobs are a few blocks apart, we should move in together, in separate rooms. Friday, me, her and a friend went to a club, and me and Amy ended up dancing. One thing led to another, and we kissed. Suddenly she pulled away and decided to go out to smoke. She told me the next day she had felt like she was kissing her brother. This hurt me, because I had patiently waiting for her to be ready to try again with me, but I accepted it. Last night however, Amys Best Friend and \"life coach\" commented on a fb status we were talking on, mentioning me and Amy should date. Within 5 minutes we had plans for a date this next Friday. I don't know how this happened, but it confused me how easily she switched me from \"brother\" to \"date.\" Her friend messaged me shes really into me and has trouble showing it. I dont know how I should go about this, and what worries me is if we decide to date before or whole we live together, how this will go. I really could use any advice you could give. Thank you.\nSummary 1 -  I [m 24] and my best friend [f 21] are moving in together next month, she told me she loved us, but she can't show it. I don't know what to do with this.\n\n**EDIT:** We both decided that we want to date. \nSummary 2 -  Me and my best friend started dating, and I was confused how easily she switched me from \"brother\" to \"date.\"\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}

Given a piece of text and two of its possible summaries, explain which summary best adheres to coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality as defined above.\n\nText - I'm in a funk because I feel routinely disrespected in all aspects of my life. How do I break the cycle?Long story short, I'm frustrated because I've become an absolute doormat. In my personal life, I feel lonely and betrayed because my friends seem okay with making plans (and talking about them in front of my face) without me. And in my professional life, I feel overworked and under-appreciated for all the extra effort I give my job. It's gotten to the point where my heart is heavy with such grief upon coming home that I just roll into bed and go to sleep.\n\nThe most frustrating part is that I feel like I'm a genuinely good person, and I give the best of myself whenever I can to people. But time and time again I'm rejected, overlooked, or just flat out ignored altogether. It's because of this that I sometimes question if I really am as good as I think, or if I do things that rub people the wrong way. Deep down in my heart I know I am, and the bewilderment I feel from being treated so differently is what brings me down. So I just take it. But sometimes, I just can't.\nSummary 1 -  I feel disrespected and left out of all my relationships / life. How do I change that?\nSummary 2 -  I feel like I'm a doormat because I don't give my best, and it's costing me dearly. How do I stop?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

My boss told me that \"people\" in my department feel like I'm not doing my work because I have my headphones on. At first I was completely flabbergasted - I mean, how could they think that? I do my work and I do it well! I use my headphones because I hear everything -must be the musician in me- and it drowns out the plentiful conversations happening in the hallway that break my train of thought and keep me from working. I should add here that my headphones are never loud enough to prevent someone from coming into my office and talking to me while they are on, although my coworkers like to pretend this is the case and come in mouthing words to me as a joke.\n\nI thought about the situation and realized it must be the generation gap. Most of my department is headed towards retirement in the next 0-10 years, and they obviously couldn't work while listening to music when they were younger, and haven't taken up the habit now.  Somewhere along the line, they arrived at the opinion that headphones = slacker. I would really like to understand how/why, and try to figure something out.  I must add that I work for a large corporation, and my friends in other departments with younger coworkers use their headphones constantly and nothing is said about it- it is just commonplace.\n\nSo what can I do to convince my department that headphones are ok, and that listening to music actually helps me work *better*?   I am thinking of putting up a sign in my office facing the door or something, but I don't know what to put on it. \n\nSo what about it? Ideas?\nSummary 1 -  How can I convince my coworkers that listening to music helps them work better, and that to listen to music is ok?\nSummary 2 -  how can I convince a bunch of old people that headphones are ok to use at work?\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

However, all we seemed to have in common was the club topic. After three months, I got bored with what we were doing together (just watching movies, staying at his place overnight, stuff like that), started feeling down/unhappy and developed unrelated medical issues. \n\nOne day, out of the blue, he came over to my place and told me he didn't want to see me anymore. After I asked, he said it was because we didn't seem to get well in conversation. \n\nNow, a few months later, he's started seeing another girl in the same club that we met. He applied for president of the club and she applied for vice and they both got their positions. However, I've been the secretary over the past year, and will have to deal with him when it comes to forwarding documentation and organising events. \n\nIt's good to see the girl happy, however, I can't get over my feelings of anxiety in seeing him in general or seeing them together. I can't really talk to the girl anymore because she mentions doing stuff together with him and it makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nSo, what I wanted to ask about was how can I teach myself to move on from my feelings of anxiety towards this guy, seeing that I will have to deal with him and his girlfriend/date with regards to the running of this club? I know that I'm not completely over him, but I really want to be so I can interact with the club without these horrible feelings.\nSummary 1 -  I got dumped 6 months ago and I want to learn how to move on from this guy and his girlfriend.\nSummary 2 -  I [20F] was dumped by a guy [21M] I was seeing for three months last year, and can't get over my anxiety and don't know how to teach myself to move on.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [0,1]}

I texted her this, and she said I haven't even seen it yet (her body) which is true but I said it didn't matter.\n\nWell last week we were talking about our turn ons and stuff, and one of mine was 50s/retro style lingerie, and I sent her a picture as an example of what I liked, and yea the girl was thin but I didn't think anything about it, but I after I said it didn't matter she texted me, \"I don't look like that girl in that lingerie picture you sent me.\" and that's the last thing I got from her. I'm pretty sure she fell asleep because she does that but I know she went to sleep upset :/\n\nHow do I let my girlfriend know that I love her and that I'm attracted to her? I don't care at all about her weight and I want her to know I only sent her that picture because I wanted to see HER in that lingerie. What should I do/say to her?\nResponse 1 -  Girlfriend texted me a picture of herself in lingerie, I didn't think anything of it, she got upset and texted me back, she said she didn't do it, how do I let her know I love her?\nResponse 2 -  Girlfriend insecure about her weight; I want her to know I love her and I'm attracted to her regardless\n\nFirst, discuss the helpfulness and honesty of each response. Then, explain which one is better overall and why.

We got in a fight at his apartment and he started swearing at me a ton. Every other word was just a swear. Eventually I said \"If you keep speaking to me that way I will leave\". I'm not the type of girl to just sit there and take it. \nIn the end he basically started throwing my things at me and kicking me out at 1:30 AM, all my belongings in hand. I was forced to walk home, about 1-2 miles. \n\nHe came back to my apartment a week later, knocked at my door, profusely apologizing. He waited 2 hours on the ledge for me to wake up and come to the door. He said sorry a lot but what set of a red flag, for me, was that he thought kicking me out was \"normal\" relationship behavior, and told me his parents did it a lot. He said he didn't think it was as big a deal as I thought it was. Although, in the end, he did say this sort of thing will never happen again. \n\nI said I couldn't just trust him that easily again. He gave me a couple days to think about it before really breaking up. I love him, he is a sweet guy (he'd never hit me or anything), but I find this incident hard to forget. He's a very sentimental, yet emotional kind of guy. Opinions? Did he just make a forgivable mistake? Am I blowing things out of proportion?\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add some details. First: He didn't throw large things at me - headphones, photos, things like that. And second, note that this is the first time it's happened in two years. \nI'm not trying to defend him, just reporting the facts. \nAlso, thank you all for your advice and support. I really appreciate it and will take it to heart.\nSummary 1 -  I left my BF for another girl, and he was apologetic. He now thinks kicking me out was \"normal\" behavior, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable.\nSummary 2 -  BF kicks me out, apologizes, gives me couple days to think things through.\n\nConsider the coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality of each summary and explain which one is better.\n\nRationale:", "rank": [1,0]}
