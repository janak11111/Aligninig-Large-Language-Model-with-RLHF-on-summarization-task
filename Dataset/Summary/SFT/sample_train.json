I immediately brought it up to the owners wives who promised to remedy the situation. \n\nTurns out that the same night I was there, possibly the exact moment, someone was stalking the wagons in the woods, and fired a BB gun at a customer, wounding her. My phone was dead and my tv was stolen so I had no idea what had occurred when I went back to follow-up on my pay the following weekend The woman at the desk identified me, called the boss, who called the detectives, who came and interrogated me. \n\nNormally, I recognize that it is a terrible idea to talk to cops because self-incrimination and all, but I was caught completely off-guard and had no idea what was going on until I eventually caught on to what had happened and they filled me in. Regardless, I may feel undervalued by with the employer but I am not a psychotic criminal. \n\nI fear that I have told them too much (which is true past hello) and that if they don't catch the perp then they will come after me. I agreed to a polygraph, and talked to my lawyer, who told me not to do it because it often comes out inconclusive. I cut off contact with detectives whom hopefully recognize that I am honest and harmless. Nonetheless, my family has been freaking out at the thought of getting raided and/or searched based on circumstantial evidence.",

They speak very rarely.\n\nThe issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.  She's relatively functional in her professional life, but she's made it clear she misses having someone to talk to the way that she talked to my dad (both are very smart people, and she has a hard time getting that with her friendships and colleagues).  She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.  Not to mention that exuding unhappiness makes you a pretty dull date!\n\nI'm worried because I'm moving to a different state soon and I want her to be on an upswing before I leave.  She's halfheartedly tried therapy and stays on antidepressants for a while but it never seems to go anywhere.  I think the bottom line is that she's unhappy, has low self worth, and is exceedingly picky about men.  What can I do to move her in the right direction?  I know that this has to come from within, but it's driving me insane watching her wallow in sadness.  I want to be sensitive but it seems so obvious she just needs to toughen up, put herself out there, and realize that she deserves happiness!",

Later that day I hopped in the shower and, following a pro-tip I learned from Reddit, used my old loofah to scrub out any extra ...residue that might have gotten caught up in my butt fro. At the exact instant the loofah came in contact with my hole, I nearly passed out from the pain. It felt as if someone had sodomized me with an industrial cheese grader. My vision started to blur and I had to brace myself against the side of the shower so I wouldn't fall down. After about 5 minutes of recovering in this position, I finally regained enough courage to examine myself. I positioned a finger to where I thought my butt hole would be and discovered a shockingly large swollen abscess that was painful to touch and very tender.\n\nSo now I'm left wondering, is this a hemorrhoid or some crazy STD? How did I get it in the first place, how do I not get it in the future and how do I make it go away? Is this normal for 23 year old guys? Thanks in advance Reddit.\n\nNote: It's been three days now and my butt hole still hurts. I haven't dared to touch it again, but I don't think the abscess has gotten any smaller. Sitting down is slightly uncomfortable, but not especially painful. \n\nAdditional Note: I was pretty drunk when I hooked up with said girl, but to the best of my knowledge, she didn't touch or interfere with my poop spout.",

I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run.

I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us \"We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there.\" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer \"You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!\" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: \"You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.\" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. \n\nSo reddit?

It's an expensive trip, but I can make it work. I think it would be money well spent. \n\nOf course my wife is not happy about this, which I can understand.

I'm not a very promiscuous guy (I've slept with only one other person before my current girlfriend, and the other person was a girl who I dated for a year).  Basically, I don't really sleep around.  This weekend, for some reason, I asked my girlfriend for the first time how many guys she has slept with. She told me I was the 9th guy. I was expecting around 3 or 4.  To me, she doesn't seem to be the type of girl who sleeps around (I don't even know if 9 guys qualifies as sleeping around).  Even in our relationship, being comfortable sexually is something we have had to work on.  That's why I was kind of shocked when she told me I was the 9th guy she's slept with.  She told me that she used to view sex as not very meaningful, but that it is very different with me.  She's told me numerous times that I mean a lot more to her than any other guys ever have.  I'm not mad at her, because I know that I can't be mad at her for doing stuff before we even knew each other.  I'm just a little uneasy/put off by the number of guys she's been with.

We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we \"broke up,\" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. \n\nThis semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.\n\nThis girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...\n\nIt has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer). I am worried about my old friends, my new friends (which she feels she has claim to) and just my happiness in general. I still love this girl a little, but I mostly just want to move on.

I also had an email exchange from a while back when we had broken up and (subsequently) gotten back together with my mother, who was just saying it sounds like we just got in a fight, she really likes her, and if we get back together, she'd be happy.\n\nThis very much angered her, and she claims she can never look at those people without feeling shame. Right now she's apartment hunting.\n\nI guess my main question here is if I did anything that terrible. I understand her embarrassment, but it wasn't anything bad, just arguments, that I was talking about. And she's flat out told me she's complained to her friends about me. Friends we used to see often.\n\nThe other thing is that it took a bit of effort for her to find those. Even just searching her name, she had to go through a few hundred messages to find anything incriminating. It feels very violating, honestly.\n\nThanks for reading. I'd like honest feedback so I don't repeat the same mistakes. I don't know if the relationship is salvageable though.",

Throughout the relationship she stressed that she wasn't one for relationships and was only involved in one with me because she loved me so much (we were each our first serious relationship).\n\nThroughout our time together she kissed another guy once and swore it'd never happen again and broke up with me once only to reconcile a week later and apologize. Around 5 months ago she broke up with me again, saying shewanted to be single her final year of college. She claimed she still loved me and if she had to be with someone it'd be me.\n\nI tried to move on and cut contact but she kept finding a way to stay relevant in my life, even though several times I asked her if she wanted to get back together to which she replied no. She said she jusy wanted to hook-up with other guys, which she has during our time apart.\n\nAs I've said, she's kept in contact despite me asking her to stop and have even had to take her to the hospital at one point. A week ago she showed up at my house saying she missed me and we agreed to meet for lunch to sort things out.\n\nAt lunch we agreed we still loved each other very much and that we should take things slowly. She says that if she finds that I'm not what she wants that she will end it for my sake. It's been a few days now and i just can't help but feel that she isn't nearly as serious about us as I am.\n\nMy question is should i even bother with the relationship at this point? I do love her but she's just such a pain in the ass and has caused me so much grief. I should note we are both graduating in May and are most likely moving to different states.

I plan on moving with him once I'm done with school. \n\nWe talk every day, have had relatively few issues, and have talked about marriage. That's what makes this whole thing so scary. It's been 4 days since I have heard anything from him. He has a history of depression and anxiety (undiagnosed because his family didn't believe him and he just sort of lives with it now) so I'm scared something finally pushed him over the edge. I try contacting his family and none have responded except for his  sister who says she hasn't heard from him in about a month. \n\nI won't be able to make it out there till next Saturday and I'm losing my mind.",

    "post": "I have recently become self aware to the fact that I have been commentating everything in my head. For example, if I have a conversation with someone, instead of listening to what they are saying, I analyze the social iteration. In my head will be nonstop questions that play louder than the actual discussion. \"Does she think I am an idiot?\"  \"Is he uncomfortable?\"  \"Does she think I am creepy for making eye contact?\" \"Does he know I am not really paying full attention?\" There are a million other questions like that.\n\nEven as I have become self-aware of this, I still can't stop it and focus. Its been a problem mostly when communicating with people, but has effected other areas of my life such as concentrating on a project at work.  Even now as I type this I can't really turn it off.\n\nI think its most troubling when having sex. Instead of getting into the zone, I am constantly thinking about all this other bullshit.  How she perceives me, how animalistic it feels, etc.  The best sex (and perhaps social interactions in general), have always been drunk.  Being drunk is the only time I can really get into the zone and turn of the internal dialogue.\n\nIs there anyone else experiencing this?  I'm sure everyone does to some extent but I feel other people have better control over it. I'm not sure if its just social anxiety disorder or what but\u2026.I'd really like to try to get a better handle over it.  What are some techniques I can practice to turn off the voice inside my head?",

    "post": "Assume you truly liked someone but something happened that kinda turned you off to them.  Nothing ridiculously bad such as abuse or being cheated on, but something along of the lines of not being emotionally available to someone and/or briefly losing that connection/spark you had with them.  Basically something that causes you to question if they actually like you or not.  Like you have doubts as to whether or not the other person likes you when originally you thought they really liked you.\n\nWould you take them back and give them a second chance?\n\nI think this happened to me - a girl doesn't know if I actually like her.  I know the typical advice for me is to move on, but in my past, I've had this happen before in which the vibe changes and actually coming on strong and apologizing ends up working.  (In fact for some reason it seems to happen a lot to me - I've had to apologize twice in my past and got second chances).  The only issue is having her believe that you are being genuine...and that's hard.  And that's something I can't do unless I see her in person but obviously her being closed prevents us from meeting in person (unless its a chance encounter).  But in the past, I've written a letter and e-mail and it worked, so maybe there is a way to not do it in person...",

I know we're both young and teenagers feel like they'll be together forever, but we have not had a single fight. Ever. \n\nWhen we first got together, it was just about \"getting some\". As time passed, however, we found that we were perfect together. We share the same interests, personality, and we still have enough difference to make it interesting. Most of you might be asking yourselves \"where's the problem?\". \n\nWell, most people get married when they're older. They go through life, getting experience, learning stuff, meeting new people, and having some good stories to tell when they're at the bar with their friends. Instead of going out and meeting people, me and my girlfriend are happy to stay at home watching movies and eating pizza. If I let myself be happy (short-term) I could be trapped in a long-term relationship (love) that would deny me these experiences. I want to be single again.\n\nThen I look at all the older people, (like some on this Reddit) that are looking for EXACTLY what I have. If I abandon my girlfriend now, I could come crawling back five depressing years from now, only to find her with another guy. That's a horrible thought.\n\nSo, I need help.",
