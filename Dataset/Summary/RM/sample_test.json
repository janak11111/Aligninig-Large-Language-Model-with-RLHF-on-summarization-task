    "post": "When we first became friends, I knew her mum had cancer - she was pretty casual about it, quite light-hearted. She mentioned at one point being on her way to sort out her will, but didn't go into much depth. Not too long ago she told me that she was stopping treatment, but again it was a pretty brief conversation. She told me two nights ago she's been given three months and now I don't know what to do.\n\nPart of the problem is I live in the UK, she lives in Canada. We only talk through iMessage and Facetime but we've been doing that for about a year and I do consider her absolutely one of my best friends and she has plans to visit this summer. \n\nWhen she messaged me to tell me it was about 2am here and we only talked for about 20 minutes. I just said the first things that came to mind, that maybe it'll be longer (although I didn't want to suggest she might be okay, I know she won't), to make the most of the time she has, that I love her and would be around for her (and so would her boyfriend) and that the world is fucking cruel sometimes.\n\nSince then, I'm just stuck. I texted to ask how she was yesterday, that was pretty awkward. Today she sent me a screenshot of a text she'd sent to her ex-boyfriend letting him know since they were together quite a while and he got on well with her mum, he didn't reply so we just slated him for a while. We haven't spoken much other than that, but we don't talk like non-stop every day anyway so that's not too odd.\n\nI just don't know how to help her. I don't want to offer just generic standard condolences, but it just feels really awkward to be my usual self and have our usual conversations, it feels like I'm acting like it's nothing. Any advice on things to say, how to deal with this or even other subs that might be helpful would be appreciated.",

    "post": "Please don't tear me apart. I screwed up and completely jeopardized a relationship with the love of my life.\n\nI used to be very active in online dating before I met my gf [1.5 yrs ago]. I rekindled an old online \"fling\" while I was going through some serious issues. It was mostly relatively innocent conversation, but also admittedly some inappropriate photos/sexy talk. We never met in person and only talked/exchanged photos a few times. I didn't physically cheat but I know what I did is just as awful.\n\nMy gf found out, I've come clean and am actually getting professional help for severe depression now (which is what I think led me to do this in the first place.. not that that justifies it).\n\nWe're living apart while I work on my many issues with therapy and introspection.. and we're doing very well. We're able to have fun together, hang out, etc. But it's not the same. (Which I understand). She's hesitant to hold my hand, kiss, etc. She says she's sorry it's taking her so long to come around physically.. that she's scared to allow herself to be vulnerable to me again.\n\nAgain... I understand this, but what I'm asking is HOW. How can I make her feel okay again? I told her to take all the time she needs. What should I do? I know time will help... but I suppose time alone isn't enough. I feel like I need to be doing something but idk what.\n\nThere are about 383849483 articles and message  boards online for how to get over being cheated ON, but very very few resources for how the cheater should handle relationship recovery. \n\nIf anyone has any insight or resources that I could look into (from the betrayer's perspective), I'd really appreciate it.",

We had a rough patch a couple of months ago, but since than things have all cleared up, and it really worked well again, but my side of the story has returned again, and I'm sure she doesn't expect this at all.\n\nWould it be best to just tell her that I'm breaking up with her, and why (keep it short), or give her time to ask questions.

I recently enrolled in my companies healthcare plan. After filling out the usual paperwork and selecting which tier of coverage I would like I was informed of a corresponding wellness program. At first I was excited about additional incentives but quickly learned that this program wasn't about encouragement and providing resources, it was about saving the company money by enforcing punitive measures for employees who don't meet certain healthcare goals.\n\nMore specifically a $25/pay period wellness surcharge and a $75/pay period tobacco use surcharge. In order to avoid the surcharges you must submit a Biometric Screening (weight, body fat composition, blood pressure, lipid panel, among other things) to HR as well as earn additional points by reaching target BMI, cholesterol levels, and even participating in telephonic or online \"health coaching sessions\".\n \nI'm a non smoker but admittedly a little over weight. Truthfully it's not an issue of being able to meet these goals but I don't feel like I should be required to share medical information with my employer that isn't relevant to my job responsibilities.\n\nl loosely understand how this type of thing can be enforced under the ACA but it seems to have some grey area regarding discriminatory actions under EEOC and ADA. \n\nI asked my employer if participation in the wellness program was mandatory and they informed me that if I wanted to enroll in the company healthcare plan that the wellness program was also required.\n\nIt may wind up being a moot point as I have another employement offer in the pipelines but I'm still really curious about what my rights are here and what courses of action I could pursue.",

This, for some odd reason, really got my dad going. He slammed the dinner table, picked it up and shoved it to the side (Keep in mind that this is a pretty fucking huge and heavy table). He starts yelling at my sis, saying how she's lazy, and she's the reason this house wont sell when it goes up on the market.

At this point my sister is away crying in her room, and I'm now sitting outside wishing I was old enough to have a beer. \n\nIt should also be noted that he has a quite sour attitude most of the time, or there's the occasion that he's \"happy\" in which is mostly consisted of annoying people and getting on their nerves. He's acted like this before, made violent threats, etc., but it's pretty rare (I could probably count on one hand). But the point is it's happened. He has never acted violently to us, although me and him got into a pseudo-wrestling match/brawl some years ago. \n\nCome to think of it, I really don't like being around my family at all.

Sometimes when I tell him something about us that's bothering me, he will just stay silent for a while and then change the subject. When I ask him what he thinks about it, he will just shrug. It's driving me mad because when I say something's wrong, I don't do it to nag, but I want to hear his side and I want to be insured that he actually listened to me.\n\nOne very recent example: I told him yesterday that I need him to communicate with me more often during the day. I did it via text, unfortunately, because we won't be seeing each other until tomorrow and it's been bugging me. He didn't react, then, this morning, he send me a funny picture, to, quote \"lighten up the mood\" unquote. I know he will not address my text. He will be better about texting for a few days/weeks, then it will be back to normal. It's driving me up the wall because I don't feel taken seriously, but I can't really address this without sounding like \"I demand that you admit you were at fault and apologize\", which is not what I want. Can anybody of you help me out here?",

I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.\nAnd here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September. Regardless of what I do, I'll still be down at least $700.\n\nI could really use some help/advice, guys. I'm at a loss at this point. I do NOT want to take out any loans.",

Nothing happened, seeing as I was in a relationship at the time which ended in January. \n\nAfter the breakup, I sign up for a online dating site, as pretty much everyone in my country does. All goes well, I chat with different guys with different intentions, and I get a message from him (not knowing that the guy that messaged me was him). I find out, he adds me on Facebook and we start chatting. A lot. \n\nAll goes well. We chat regularly, until one day it's like he's lost interest, which is fine by me really. I didn't think of him as anything else but a friend with a potential crush incoming. Later, I find out he's in a relationship. Fine, great for him! I hope he's happy.\n\nNow they've broken up, happened about 2 months ago. We start chatting again, and it ended with him deciding to come and spend the weekend with me (and my family.) - And he lived one and a half hour away at the moment. I go to college in his town, so it's shorter when it's not summer.\n\nAnyway! We have sex. A LOT of sex. Great sex as well. We cuddled all night, chatted, fooled around, laughed. He kissed my forehead and told me goodnight. So sweet! \n\nBut last night, earlier during the evening, he tells me that he's not sure he's ready for a relationship because of his shitty the other one ended. We were talking about his ex and he added that into the convo. Nothing weird.\n\nI have a raging crush on him. What do I do?",

Overall we have had a great relationship, we both trust each other, we have A LOT in common, we do almost everything together, and I do love her with all my heart. The problem is though, I am her first serious boyfriend and she doesn't know how to communicate. If I ask her something about us, or bring up something that has been bothering me, her immediate response is \"I don't know\", and she never wants or is willing to talk about it. \nFor instance, right now I am out of town for two weeks due to tonsil surgery, and she hasn't started a conversation once. She didn't even ask how I was doing after surgery, I had to call her. So when I brought this up to her last night, and asked what was going on, her response was \"I only miss you sometimes, and I don't know why I don't text you\". \nNow I have been as patient as possible with the whole thing, not pushing her to tell me things, trying to help her with how she can communicate with me. But the one time I have pushed her for an answer she said she felt like \"something was missing\" and how I am her first real boyfriend and \"falling in love with [me] wasn't what she expected\". \nSo I am really at a loss here, I love this girl to death, my life would be quite empty and boring without her. But if these communication problems we have been having continue, I don't think our relationship will. It really seems at the moment like she has an indifferent attitude towards our relationship.\nSo do you fine people have any suggestions of what I can do? Or is it a hopeless cause? Because I really don't want to lose her.",

I should add that I've also lived with girls as roommates in the past and never had any issues- it's completely normal to me.\n\nAnyways, my girlfriend, who I have been dating for eight months, is not happy at all with this situation. She has told me that she is very uncomfortable with me living with girls. She lives about an hour away from my campus so we can typically see each other once or twice a week and on weekends. She has told me that she doesn't like that other girls will get to be with me every day when she can only see me a few times a week.\n\nIt comes across as jealousy even though I've told her many times that these girls and I are strictly friends and I have zero interest in any of them. She's very dismissive when we try to talk about it and says things like \"I don't want to hear your explanations\" and that I'm a \"dick\" for not sympathizing with her. Our last few conversations about it have lead to her hanging up on me\n\nSo what I'm wondering is, what can I do to improve this situation? Is she justified in being as upset as she is about this?
