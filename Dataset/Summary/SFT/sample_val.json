    "post": "When the internet began to pick up speed in the days of the 56k modem, I remember fearful talks about how this new technological tool would revolutionize the contemporary era. \n\nOutside of highly accessible porn, mass mp3 theft, and the rise of troll culture I don't really feel that the internet has lived up to its expectations. \n\nI look at the recent financial crisis, the BP oil spill, and the state of the US energy infrastructure at large and I can't help but wonder if the internet will one day provide us will an effective tool to apply collective social pressure to stop these travesties. It feels like a far off utopian ideal. \n\nYet I see places like reddit full of people that at least seem like they care. \n\nIn theory the internet is the ultimate tool for social connection and information exchange. This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. \n\nThis then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).\n\nThe ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). \n\nHowever I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. \n\nHence I ask, \"Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution?\"\n\nWhen I ask this I do not want the opinion of \"people\" or \"society at large\". I am wondering how you personally feel about taking on such an endeavor.",

    "post": "Aparently on monday the United states has reached its debt ceiling of 14 trillion dollars, and while i'd like to consider myself fairly well informed on how it got into this position of massive debt im not entirely clear on what reaching a debt ceiling means for the American economy.\n\nProposals from both sides of the political spectrum say that a reduction of spending is needed (with democrats proposing raising taxes in the upper braket?) but how big of a chunk of an anual budget would really be needed to put a dent in 14 trillion? You dont accumulate that kind of debt over night and i have difficulty seeing exactly how any reduction could even allow them to break even let alone start reducing this debt load given the rather large deficit administrations have been running.\n\nAnd lets say for a minute that they cant figure out a way to ease off this debt ceiling, what are the consiquences for inaction?

He told me he couldn't handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the \"I love you's\" and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn't tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to \"lose\" me if he'd told me.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he'd rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We'd meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he'd done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. \n\nWhen I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back. He said his girlfriend is great but not as \"amazing\" as me.  He missed the connection we had. I feel the same way. And now I think we're equally confused.

    "post": "Last week I made some really poor life choices. I am a 20 year old male and I met a girl on OkCupid. Her age was 18 on the app but when we talked she said that she was really 17. We talked for a bit and sexted (no pictures whatsoever, only dirty talk). I am an incredibly lonely guy so she somehow convinced me to take a greyhound bus into another state and sneak into her house while her parents were asleep. We were NOT going to do anything sexual, just hanging out cuddling and kissing, stuff like that. I have never been in a relationship and I didn't even want to do that but I decided to do it against my gut feeling. So I ended up going and sneaking in and after about 2 minutes in her house we were immediately caught, I apologized, then I left the house and cut off contact with this girl. It turns out that she is 16, which is still within the legal age range.\n\nToday I got a series of terrifying messages on Skype from this girl. She said that the entire time she had planned on \"taking my virginity then cutting me open with a knife and making me love her or else she would kill me.\" Then apparently she overdosed because of me and said that her parents and counselors were telling her to file a report against me for all of this because her father is a lawyer. I am still receiving many threatening skype messages threatening both me and my brother who drove me home that night. \n\nI am terrified right now, she is saying that she's going to go into her office(she works with her father at his office) and is going to file a report against me tomorrow for breaking and entering, sexting with a minor, and causing emotional distress to a minor. Please reddit, help me out, I'm terrified right now and feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.\n\nI have all of the text and skype conversations with her saved but I'm about to pass out. I can't breathe and my arms are going numb. Please help me.  I'm in Pittsburgh and the events happened in West Virginia",

I took it on, and because I was so new, I didn't know about or use the time tracking tools Elance has built in to guarantee payment. I know, stupid of me, but so it goes.

Elance said since I hadn't used their time tracking tools, all they could do was give me contact information. I tried and got nothing -- no surprise, since all they had was an email address and a fake phone number. So that was a dead end.\n\nBut I was able to identify and reach some of the webmasters who had originally commissioned the articles, and one told me he'd bought it from someone on Fiverr. I talked to the Fiverr person and she said she'd outsourced it to a friend (uh huh) and had no idea it was stolen. She refused to tell me who she'd outsourced it to. I suspect she probably resold most, if not all, of my stolen work. Unfortunately, Fiverr doesn't seem to have a way to see what jobs someone has done, so that seems to be another dead end.\n\nI guess my question is, is there any point in reporting to Fiverr?

Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it. From the advice from other gearheads, it can't be easy to fix or safe to use without causing more damage. Already made a craigslist ad to at least get some money for another one. F you \"EL NINO\"",

I'm not sure how to explain without being rude.\n\nAnother thing to note: He was virgin when we met and we had sex a couple times. He was really nervous about it, so it wasn't good sex.

Because I'm a lawyer I stay rather calm, even when there's a fight and hate when it gets too emotional and dramatic. After an hour everything that can be said, is said. It just makes me feel so weird, when she keeps going. I just hate it. I don't make her responsible for it as a person, because every girl I've been with long enough has her moments.\n\nAnyway. We got into the fight on a Thursday. On Friday she came around and she was being cute again. I didn't feel like it was over for me and I was annoyed that she thought it was okay just like that. Anyway, I left town the same day and stayed in San Diego over the weekend. The result was that I fucked 3 women until Sunday was over. To be honest, I didn't enjoy the sex that much. It's so much better with my girlfriend. Without emotions it doesn't mean much.\n\nThe last time I posted it, everyone told me to confess it, but I never planned to do that and I will not do it. There is no way to prove that it happened, not even I could prove it. She doesn't suspect a thing. I picked up the phone to talk to her even when someone else was there, so she thinks I was alone the whole time.\n\nSo I came back and now it's going better than ever. I realized that I want her and that as her boyfriend I am able to control her emotions a fair bit. Not in a mean way, but I want her to feel appretiated and happy, and not the need to start fights to get what she wants. Also I feel like that weekend gave me a chance to think about us and what I want. It's definitely her. She's beautiful, smart and 99% of the time super loving. I wouldn't want to miss her.",

To be fair, this is a relatively new apartment/ area for her, and she's been laid up and hasn't been able to explore/ meet the neighbors.\n\n  It usually goes down like so: Milly sees a person in the distance and goes on alert (ears up, tail up, eyes focused). I usually at this point try to distract her with a, \"Hey, Milly, it's just our neighbor.  thanks for letting me know they are there!\" If they keep walking toward us, or we keep walking toward them, she usually breaks into the crazy greeting dance of her people (total wiggle butt, hoping side to side, ears up but relaxed).  We're working on a more relaxed greeting.  At this point I usually make her sit and stay by my side until she calms down.  \nWell, if they don't move toward us (fair enough when she's clearly on alert), or she isn't allowed to get closer/ investigate she will bark.  Not a low bark, but a higher \"hey, you! Friend?\" kind of bark.  At this point I say, \"enough\" sternly and work with her until she will heel beside me and then we sit calmly once she's away from the stimulus.

I'm in a serious relationship and we're planning on getting married in a little over a year and starting to **try** having kids immediately, but we will probably end up adopting. While adopting is wonderful and that thought excites me, I still so badly want to be pregnant one day. \n\nMy sister being pregnant is like a kick in the side. A reminder that I'll never be pregnant. I don't want to be around her, I don't want to be happy for her. I'm jealous. I don't know how to deal with this. I never expected to feel anger towards my sister for getting pregnant. But really, how am I expected to feel about this?\n\nI would never dare tell my sister or anyone else in my family how I feel about this. I wouldn't want to upset anyone and I really don't want to be selfish and make this about me. It's just so hard.",

We have talked about it and agreed that the relationship should terminate this summer when he goes to college. He and I clearly agreed to this plan, but he has repeatedly spoken in direct contrast to it, making me confused.  He will get worked up and say desperate things like, \"stay with me forever\", \"never ever forget me\", \"never leave me\", and even \"lets get married\". Obviously we are too young for any of this to be realistic. Last time he did this, I played along for the sake of the mood, and said \"of course we will be together forever\". It made me feel dishonest, because it is lie and we both know it. I'm worried he might actually believe me when I say those things, when this goes against what we agreed on rationally. Is this just some cute tactic he is employing where you make up alternative endings when you want to be romantic? Am I over thinking this? Is it all just dirty talk? When I remind him that we are breaking up and not staying together forever he gets sad and says I am scaring him. I don't want either of us to feel lead on or get hurt when the time comes to say goodbye.",
