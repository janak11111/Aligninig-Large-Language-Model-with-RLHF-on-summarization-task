However, if there is a gain or appreciation in the value of the property, that gain may be subject to capital gains taxes. If the beneficiary of the estate chooses to sell the inherited property, they are liable for any capital gains taxes related to the sale. In addition, any income the beneficiary earns from the inherited property\u2014such as rent or other income\u2014is subject to ordinary income taxes. \n\nHuman: Why might I owe taxes on an inheritance if there isn't a gain in value associated with it?\n\nAssistant:",

Additionally, certain large gifts from relatives may also require that you or the deceased file a federal gift tax return."
