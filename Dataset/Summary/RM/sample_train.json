The paramedics said that he saved his own life today by knowing when to call (which lots of people don't do), for which I'm so proud and thankful, but I'm also really terrified. If he hadn't have received the shot of adrenaline that they gave him, they said he would most likely be dead.\n\nThe nurse at the hospital said that it will get worse from here if this happens again. She mentioned things like dust and mold, which are a no-brainer to keep away, but it's frustrating to not know what else I can do. I don't know how it can get much worse than this, and could really use some tips on what I can do to make this less likely. What can I do to assure the safety of my boyfriend without having to throw him in a plastic bubble?

He pays his portion of the rent and his bills, but I am stuck always footing the bill in terms of food, necessities, and luxuries. Half the time he will buy himself things and if he can't pay his bills from overspending, I will pay them. On top of that, after I get home from work (and keep in mind I work 10 - 12 hours every day. He works 8), I immediately cook dinner and if I don't cook, I buy us takeout. If I don't clean, things pile up and if I ask him to do it, he will get annoyed and ask me what I'm going to do in terms of cleaning as well. It's frustrating.

Even after our first couple of dates I was still going out with other guys--I even ended up sleeping with one of them. But I couldn't stop thinking about how this one was different/special.

Here is my evidence to this theory: \n-He always makes time to see me when he does have a break from work.\n-I've met his siblings.\n-His friends have met me/remember me from the multiple times we've gone out with them.\n-He likes cuddling with me and holding my hand.\n-He kisses my forehead when we're laying on the couch watching movies.\n-He opens doors for me (even my own car door, when I'm the one driving).\n-He offers to do things around the house for me.\n-He brings me unexpected/thoughtful gifts.",

She's amazing and for the first 4 months, I legitimately thought she was the greatest girlfriend I ever had. Yet there's been some things that really bother me. Like for example when she happens to pass by me at school, sometimes she won't even say hi to me. When we hang out with mutual friends, she completely ignores me and her excuse is that she just doesn't know who to talk to when we're hanging out (me or her friends). Around Christmas time I brought this up and how it's hurt me and suggested taking a break. After about a weeklong break, she decided to break up with me and it hurt me a lot. However after about 4 days I had a heart to heart talk with her and we got back together. However recently she hasn't really been talking to me as much, and seems to always choose her friends over me. In the last couple of weeks, my parents have had issues and so I somewhat drifted apart from my gf. Even though I'm crazy about her, she asked me if I still had feelings for her and I said of course I do. When I asked her the same question, she replied \"Yes, but a little less since you've been acting distant with me recently.\" Also during our break, her friend told me that she was pretty much over me and was going to go on a date with another guy she thinks is cute. I don't know what to do now and just need advice. I'm still crazy about her, but it seems like she just doesn't feel the same way about me and I just don't want to let go of her.",

Initially we lived in different cities and only saw each other on weekends. So we'd have sex once a week. He said he wasn't into sexting or sharing pictures online because it was too impersonal (which I didn't agree with but I accepted that as a reasonable preference).\n\nAfter the first couple of months of dating he just started rejecting me through body language and some weekends we wouldn't have sex. We talked about it and he'd say things like \"I feel like that part of me is broken from last relationships\" or \"This is just how I've always been\".\n\nAnother detail is that he watches porn a decent amount. He has porn on his phone and he doesn't even try to clear the bookmarks or cookies from our laptop browser. I've brought that up too, saying I totally have nothing against porn but it's replacing me. It also really hurts my self esteem because he has one fetish - obscenely large tits. I'm very average size, maybe even on the smaller side. He says maybe he's addicted to porn and he wants to get better and maybe he should get help. But it's been over 6 months of him saying this with no change.\n\nWe've had sex maybe 3-4 times in 3 months living together and I try to ask him if there's anything causing this. Is it me? No. Are you not attracted to me? I'm so attracted to you! Is there something I'm doing that makes you uncomfortable? No, not at all. Do you feel ashamed after or dirty? No, I feel great and close to you.\n\nI've done nothing but try to accommodate him and to try to create positive and open sexual experiences and trust. When we first started dating he couldn't keep his hands off of me and I have always been very sexually confident. Now it's a surprise if he holds my boob while cuddling. Three weeks ago I told him it feels like we're just best friends living together and he got really upset and said he didn't agree.",

I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions? My friend says this girl is leading me on and using me for attention and once she gets her fix she bails.\n\nThanks Reddit!",

Our whole relationship was a lie. It just about wrecked me.  \n\nI came into this new relationship kind of hesitantly, warning the guy about my past. I'm fine with my SO having female friends, but I recognize that I'm more likely to get jealous now than I was before. My boyfriend has been a complete delight, totally patient and willing to talk through anything with me.  \n\nUnfortunately, my jealousy came to a head this weekend. I help run a cycling team, and I had recruited a new girl. She's lovely, and she's from the UK. I chatted with her a bit, but my boyfriend talked to her for quite a while. I had to remind him that we had to be somewhere.  \n\nToday, he was asking me about her, and he texted me \"That accent <3.\" He's never used a heart emoji or anything about me before. I just... I know it's so small, and so insignificant, but I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it. I'm so jealous. And it brings back all of the self-blame from the last relationship. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, and that's why no guy really wants to be with me. I'm just a placeholder.  \n\nAt this point, I'm kind of ready to throw this relationship away. I want someone who thinks I'm great, and why should I waste my time with someone who doesn't? But then again, that's an awfully strong reaction for just one text, right? I can't decide if I'm overreacting here.  \n\nSo. Yeah. One text, and I'm a mess, and I blame my ex.

My brother just went to a Halloween party as Dante from Devil May Cry and looks like an absolute BAMF, so next year it's my turn. I have Powerisers (aka Kangaroo Legs) which I will use as my stilts but I need to make longer arms.\n\nI know I've seen them before on YouTube but I can't recall how I found them. Searching terms like \"longer mechanical arms\" or \"How to make mechanical arms\" doesn't work. I was wondering if anyone had a link or a specific name for these and they could help me out?\n\nTo be more descriptive of what I'm looking for; They are things you strap to your forearm and have either a glove or a series of rings to grip. By pulling the individual fingers / rings, you cause the mechanical hand at the end of the fake-arm to contract. I heard there was also a way to make the thumb contract as well. Obviously the finger movements are restricted to simply contracting and expanding. I was just wondering if anyone had a link to a simple how-to to create the rings-to-hand mechanics in the arm. The reason I'm confused on how they work is because you can make the fingers contract without the strings / wires being in the way of the palm.\n\nUsing these and the Poweriser stilts, I hope to make a very tall, long-limbed (as he is anyway) Jack Skellington costume. I have an entire year to work on it so hopefully it'll be good.",

The whole time she was smiling and laughing and acting very interested, at mine we slept together again but this time I drove her home because she said she needed to go home for class the next day.\n\nA few times I text messaged her and got no answer, or a really delayed no-hearted reply, so I stopped and figured she would talk to me if she wanted to. Didn't hear from her for about 3 weeks then one night I was drinking and having a party so I sent her a message at around 6:30pm - \"Hey how are you! I'm having a party and heading out later, what are you up to?\" and I got a reply - \"Going out with some friends, wanna meet up later?\". Which I did, I went to hers and basically we just fooled around for a few hours, had some great chats in bed, laughed a lot, she complimented my body and looks, teased each other. Then I went home because I had work the next day (I originally offered her to come to mine and I would drive her home the next day but she wanted me to go to her and then leave...)\n\nSo...I'm not really sure what situation I'm in, FWB?

My sister has recently ended a relationship with her military husband of 2 years I think, her and her kids moved back home with our parents and has from that time gone off and gotten completely drunk at the bar and from alcohol she buys. She treats her children terribly at times, especially her older daughter. They yell at each other about every day and always ends up with her daughter crying, there is some hitting but none of it is physical abuse (although I know this is still bad). I do believe there was some abuse between her ex husband and her family, but I do not know the extent of the abuse, all I know is that her oldest has become more defiant to mostly anyone that's taking care of her, refusing to do anything and just ignoring them completely. My mother has tried constantly to get them some counseling or therapy to find out whats wrong but my sister never acts on it. A co-worker of mine has told me what could be wrong with the oldest daughter, she told me that she could be mad at her mom due to how she was treated when she was with her ex-husband and also how her oldest had to take care of her sister when her mother was passed out drunk on the couch.\n\nI fear for my sister and her family, if anyone does call her in to any kind of Child abuse prevention she will lose her daughters and they will be forced on my mom as she is first on a list they agreed on a few years ago, and myself and my parents can't afford nor have the time to take care of them.

They are now refusing to refund our money even through we payed them directly and ended up with an illegal to inhabit apt!\nSo anyone else been in a similar situation?

We have our small issues but all in all she is the only girl that can potentially be the one for me.\n\nThen there's this other girl (29F), a coworker of mine. She's a nice girl and I love spending time with her. Over the past 2 years or so we got closer and closer to the point where we both confessed we were feeling something that was more than what it should have been for each other.\n\nThis thing has grown on me to the point I told her I wanted to stay with her and break up with my current gf. Which means I would have *sacrificed* my relationship with my gf in order to stay with her. Despite her having problems with her current bf (32M), she refused to break up with him to stay with me. She chose him.\n\nThing is, we continue to be very close, she flirts with me from time to time and she definitely loves having me around. This for me is becoming unbearable, and as much as I try to deny it to myself, I'm deeply and desperately in love with her and would do literally anything to have her.\n\nThe result is that I don't know what to do with my gf. My feelings for the other girl make me realize I don't love her anymore and she doesn't deserve being with somebody who doesn't love her.\nHowever, this other girl rejected me so there's a possibility I will forget her at some point and fall in love with my gf again.\nIn the meanwhile I know being close with the other girl is just unhealthy (and useless!) but I can't help it... whenever she looks for me I'm gonna be there because... well I love her to death... and the butterflies in the stomach, you know.

She actually explicitly asked me that we should both get a coffee together at school and I expedited it by suggesting that we should go to our university's kickoff game. She said yes and that it'd be a new thing for her to try but later that night, she said she couldn't go because she had to work an on call shift. (She's a high school tutor so it's busy season now). I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions? My friend says this girl is leading me on and using me for attention and once she gets her fix she bails.\n\nThanks Reddit!",

Initially we lived in different cities and only saw each other on weekends. So we'd have sex once a week. He said he wasn't into sexting or sharing pictures online because it was too impersonal (which I didn't agree with but I accepted that as a reasonable preference).\n\nAfter the first couple of months of dating he just started rejecting me through body language and some weekends we wouldn't have sex. We talked about it and he'd say things like \"I feel like that part of me is broken from last relationships\" or \"This is just how I've always been\".\n\nAnother detail is that he watches porn a decent amount. He has porn on his phone and he doesn't even try to clear the bookmarks or cookies from our laptop browser. I've brought that up too, saying I totally have nothing against porn but it's replacing me. It also really hurts my self esteem because he has one fetish - obscenely large tits. I'm very average size, maybe even on the smaller side. He says maybe he's addicted to porn and he wants to get better and maybe he should get help. But it's been over 6 months of him saying this with no change.\n\nWe've had sex maybe 3-4 times in 3 months living together and I try to ask him if there's anything causing this. Is it me? No. Are you not attracted to me? I'm so attracted to you! Is there something I'm doing that makes you uncomfortable? No, not at all. Do you feel ashamed after or dirty? No, I feel great and close to you.\n\nI've done nothing but try to accommodate him and to try to create positive and open sexual experiences and trust. When we first started dating he couldn't keep his hands off of me and I have always been very sexually confident. Now it's a surprise if he holds my boob while cuddling. Three weeks ago I told him it feels like we're just best friends living together and he got really upset and said he didn't agree.",

We're about five months in, and I really miss not being able to have any time with her during this break, due to her job. \nToday, we had a miracle, as she was able to have a date with me. So we were in the restaurant, and she would occasionally look and pick up her phone. Mind you, I had my phone out of reach, because I didn't want to be bothered by anyone during my only time with my girlfriend. Anyways, she would occasionally read a text all quickly, laugh, and then turn it off. This happened at least a couple times, and each time, it would be the same process. I wasn't too bothered by it, until she said she was \"going to the bathroom\". She wasn't even there for a minute, and she took her phone with her. So I knew she was answering texts from her friends. This pissed me off, cuz the way she went along with answering her texts was very suspicious. And I also noticed one time I was turned and had to get the bill, she was on her phone yet AGAIN. I was just really annoyed, because I've acknowledged her that she and I would not talk to other people while we are on dates, doing stuff together. So my question is:\n\nAm I overreacting? Am I really just being paranoid about her texting other people?\n\nThanks for the help Reddit, and sorry for that wall of text.",

When I had just turned 12, we moved in with a boyfriend of hers who had a son \"Carl\" that was a little older than me. We got along really well and eventually figured out we both liked guys. Long story short, we messed around and...were boyfriends? As much as kids could be. He was my first everything. We didn't tell anyone. My mom eventually dumped his dad and we moved out. Carl and I kept in touch, hung out at school and kept \"dating\". We were really scared of telling anyone so we kept it a secret and really only told our friends. After we both graduated, we rented an apartment together and we've been together ever since. I've never dated anyone else and neither has he really. \n\nMy mom is disgusted with us and we are currently very low contact because she called my best friend from college  and told her I was screwing my brother. She stopped talking to me and told all my other friends. His dad doesn't talk to me either, and only calls my boyfriend when he wants something. It's weird. I have nothing to contribute when other people talk about dating or relationships. When it comes up, I don't really know what to say. When people ask how we met, I usually lie. My boyfriend hates it when I do that and tells me it make him feel like I'm ashamed of him.  And the messed up thing is I kind of am? Not really of him but I feel like our relationship is this big \"THING\" about my life that I can't talk about. \n\nI feel like my boyfriend and I have a pretty good relationship.
