I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??\",\n",
