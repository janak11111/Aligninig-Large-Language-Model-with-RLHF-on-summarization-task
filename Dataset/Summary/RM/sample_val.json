But this has happened before...we'll stop talking for awhile and then when I'm back in town, you'll seem excited to see me. But then you won't talk to me after that. Admittedly, part of this is my fault since I'm so damn anxious about venting my problems at you so I talk to you less as well when I'm depressed. Which I have been for almost two years now.\n\nI'm just so confused and I'm sick of worrying about it.\n\nBut the thing is, other than B, you're pretty much my only other friend and I'm holding on. I'm afraid of scaring B off too. You both deserve better. And you do have better-your friends are awesome and I'm so glad you're happy. I am such a fucking trainwreck. It's no coincidence that you two are the only ones left who care about me (?) outside my family...and they also question whether you are really my friend or not.\n\nFuck. I'm so lonely. Lonely and angry. There are times when I hate almost everyone because I feel like they're so superficial and there is no such thing as genuine connections anymore. I just want unapologetic honesty. I know there are people out there like that but in the age of social media it just seems so rare. But I also don't want people who only see the good in me (or visa versa). I want someone to see me as I am: as this paradox filled with both beautiful and ugly. \n\nI want to hold on but I also feel like moving on might be healthy? Perhaps it's possible to make new friends and keep the old, but when the making new friends part isn't really happening, it's so hard to let go of the old even if it's time to do so.",

    "post": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 6.5 years. I'm 31, she's 29. We're planning on doing the marriage thing and buying a house in the next few years. As of now, we live in an apartment. She has a son that I adore.\n\nOur finances are not co-mingled. She has her money, I have mine, and we talk about who needs to pay what bills. It's a 60/40 split, and I carry the 60. Sometimes she pays for dinner, sometimes I pay for the groceries. It all works out.\n\nIn April, we decided that we'd sock away her tax return. Wanted to use it as a down payment for a house. Today, I find out that she's spent most of it- there's only about $1000 left.\n\nShe's been irresponsible with money before. We've talked about it. I trusted her with the tax refund, and now it's gone. Tonight, as I was screaming at her for squandering the house down payment, she broke into tears and said that she \"just couldn't help herself\". Then she asked me if I could just take over all of the finances.\n\nShe's mentioned it before, and I've considered it before. Taking over the finances, and letting her have a sort of allowance for her expenses- it seems like pooling our money would give it more power, more \"oomph\". I used to fear that it would lead to loathing and hatred of me- the guy that keeps all of her hard-earned money and tells her how much she has to spend. This is why I've never followed through on taking over everything.\n\nAt 31, I can't help but feel as if we're woefully behind on savings accounts, emergency funds, house purchasing, etc.\n\nI'm over it. If my taking over the finances was her idea, and the current arrangement isn't working, then why not try it?\n\nI'm looking for any and all opinions, perspectives and comments. Thanks in advance for your help.",

During this period my girlfriend and I had several arguments about whether or not I should just deal with my parents crap. \n\nSlowly but surely over this timeframe, she started distancing herself from me, and spending time with my friends outside of school. I confronted her on this once and she got defensive and replied \"It's not like you spend any time with me anyway!\". After this I decided to let it slide. It was obviously her trying to fill in the gaps in her now surprisingly empty schedule. I knew something was up when this behaviour continued after my grounding ended. Finally the inevitable happened. Two weeks ago she dumped me completely off-hand with no kindness or pain. She preceeded to hang off my best friend for every free moment. They even kissed right in front of me. She had known him for 5 weeks before she decided to dump me.

After I asked, he said it was because we didn't seem to get well in conversation. \n\nNow, a few months later, he's started seeing another girl in the same club that we met. He applied for president of the club and she applied for vice and they both got their positions.

Ive been with my girlfriend for 3 years, she is my first girlfriend we've had an amazing relationship (she helped me through a bout of clinical depression), and we've always had a few things that we agreed on. For example, we decided early on that we would not drink because I have had huge issues with that in my family and she was also worried about how i would be if i did. Well long story short, I found out that last weekend she and one of her friends got EXTREMELY drunk at a party, and she had sex with another guy there. What makes it worse is that I was friends with said guy, and I know he has a bad habit of convincing drunk girls to screw him. Now she has done a huge part by confessing to me that she did this, and she wants me to take her back. However, she also lied and cheated on me. Honestly, I would like to be with her but I'm worried about how I could live with her knowing that somewhere in her mind, she could still agree to hurt me like this.

It ran perfectly with occasional hiccups due to viruses and such for two years, but for the past year or so it has been almost unbearable to use according to my family members.

The screen still shows everything that was occurring, but is completely unresponsive.\n\nNow, the BSoD's I think has to do with a hardware component of the computer failing, and the clicking leads me to believe it's the hard drive (It basically sounds like something that happens whenever the hard drive is required to start up).

My family ruined my college, repeatedly kicked me out for no reason, etc. But that's in the past.\nI am now living with my mother and her fiance. I'm only staying here so that I can get my A.A, (decided to find a way to fix what was done and go to college), then when I get that I'm moving across the country, finishing my Bachelors, masters, and then eventually PhD. The problem is- my step father, and sometimes even my mother(although she has calmed down quite a bit in comparison to what she used to be) are incredibly emotionally abusive, and I'm not sure I can take more of it. I still have a whole year to get through for the A.A. and I'm constantly hearing things such as \"fat ass\"(not even overweight, but I was when I was younger and they know it gets to me), or \"you're useless\" or \"lazy, stupid bitch.\" Etc. Let me also state, I not only take 5 classes but I also work about 30 hours a week, and pay them rent. But anytime I get sick(I have a chest infection, just went to the doctor) they assume I'm being lazy and don't want to go to work. Even without the sickness, I have to deal with this stuff all the time - they've even threatened to kick me out(knowing i can't afford an apartment by myself here) because I refuse to be around my step father when he's being a dick.\n\nI already have borderline personality disorder, diagnosed from childhood trauma and let me say that's hard enough to deal with even normal personal relationships.

    "post": "Hi all,\n\nBeen reading /r/personalfinance for a few weeks now and I've learned a ton already. Using the information from here we've sorted out our finances and we're pretty happy with where we're at. Current amount that we budget each month is about $3.7k, which includes everything from mortgage payment (+ an additional 1/12 for an additional payment each year) to groceries, Roth IRA contributions for my wife and I, and 529 plan contributions for our son (only $25/mo so we don't get dinged by the admin fee, which they charge if we don't have automatic monthly contributions). We take home about $4k/month, so we have an additional $300 or so a month that we're chucking into a fund for a down payment on a new house, which we expect we'll start looking for in ~2+ years. We'd sell our current house and given the current estimated value vs. amount remaining on the loan we'd probably get ~$100k. \n\nAnyway, my questions...\n\nFirst, we have $25k socked away for our emergency fund (about 6+ months expenses), the vast majority of which is sitting in Barclays earning 1% interest. I know this is somewhat controversial and people do have strong opinions about this, but I've also seen that some people tier their EF. To make that EF money work a bit more for us, we've been thinking of investing maybe half or a third of it conservatively, while having at least one month available through checking and the remainder continue to sit at Barclays. Is that crazy? We also have about $12k in a taxable account with Betterment that I invested in a few years ago and haven't done much with since.\n\nSecond, our current down payment fund is just over $18k. It also sits at Barclays. Should we be putting this money in I bonds to match inflation, or just keep on putting money into it? Should we do something similar and invest part of it? \n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts, and sorry for the wall of text!",

He's \"really smart, and kind, and caring.\" I follow up with \"As kind and caring as me?\" It takes her a minute to reply, which was an answer in and of itself, and she says \"he's *as* kind and caring as you.\" She said she's really curious about what it would be like to date him, and that they were ships passing in the night, never single at the same time. To quote her further, \"You're my world, but he's like Africa.\" (We like Indiana Jones and adventure type novels/movies/posters, so Africa is a metaphor for the unexplored and mysterious.)\n\nShe went on to tell me that she actually had more of a past with the guy, that back before I met her, he used to walk her to her dorm every night, and flirted hard till he found out she had a boyfriend, and I think she liked him more than she let on.\n\nShe told me how much she loved being with me, but that she just doesn't know what to do. I told her I was going to take some time to think on it, but I don't know what to say.\n\nThey're in theater together, which means they spend at least four hours a day together, and *their characters are in love.* Other members of the theater department make side remarks that he's been acting odd as of late too.

I loved 70% of my job and I hated the rest of the 30% which involved a lot of bs and politics within the company that really overtook the good sides of the job. I was also being fed up with Kpop scenes so I ended up quitting the job early 2014.\n\nI left Korea right after I quit to try something else. I wasn't doing too well but I definitely enjoyed my time learning and seeing new things in music scenes of N. America. At the end of the day though I was always worried about my visa status and was thinking about leaving and going back to Korea at some point this year.\n\nThis January I got a phone call from my old boss and he offered a position with a raise and promotion. The company was doing a lot better than the time I left so I decided to take it without really trying to know where the company is at and how things are doing now, because I thought I knew the place.\n\nI packed everything early and rushed back here about a few weeks ago and started the job right away. It didn't take 2 days for me to figure out I absolutely hate the job. It's been slightly more than 2 weeks and I got reminded why I had quit in the first place. My boss had to convince a few executives to bring me back - for his convenience obviously -although everyone thought I did a great job before I left. I really don't see my future here, don't want to negotiate my terms because I don't see myself working with these guys long term.

It is a serious medical condition that causes all sorts of medical problems.\n\nI was 274 pounds at 26 years old, and I was tired of it.

Part of me is worried that he might think I'm ungrateful and take me off it and part of me feels that this dinner would be good closure. I'm really torn. I feel like if my boyfriend trusts me this dinner shouldn't be an issue and he's being insecure. Why can't two adults have a dinner? I don't like feeling like he can tell me what I can and cannot do. At the same time I know how hard it would be to be understanding about this. Caught between a rock and a hard place here.\nWhat do?",

    "post": "I'm loath to knock what's working, but I just wanted to double-check if this is something normal.\n\nI abruptly changed my unhealthy diet into a healthy one about two months ago. Every other time I've tried losing weight, I tried following all the common advice out there: eat breakfast, eat several small meals throughout the day, eat no less than 1200 calories every day, all that stuff. And every time, I was miserable, irritable, constantly ate well over my calorie limit, and eventually gave up entirely.\n\nThis time around, I decided to just stick to nutritious foods and aim for 1100-1300 calories a day with none of those other rules. The first week, it was hard to stick in the range, but in the next several weeks, I never went over (with pretty much no effort). Then maybe 2-3 weeks ago, I developed this sort of eating rhythm that cycles every 3 days or so. \n\n* Day 1, I have virtually no appetite. I'll eat only nutritionally-dense foods and average a few hundred calories. \n\n* Day 2, I'm somewhat hungrier than day 1, but not much. I might do 700-800 calories on Day 2. \n\n* Day 3, I have a normal appetite and will usually eat 1200-1500 calories.\n\nAdditionally, I usually don't get hungry until early afternoon (so no breakfast) and I make all my own meals from whole ingredients (pretty much the only packaged food is tortillas). I eat when I'm hungry, my moods are stable and positive, and I feel just fine. Even on days that I work out, I have plenty of energy and rarely want more food afterward. For once, I'm actually losing weight *and* feeling good. My health problems are disappearing as well.\n\nSo it doesn't seem this is a problem because it just feels right, but it's been drilled into my head for so long that THIS SHIT WILL KILL YOU AND MAKE YOU FAT that I can't help but think I'm doing something wrong. Is this a common eating pattern, or a healthy one?",

I recently enrolled in my companies healthcare plan. After filling out the usual paperwork and selecting which tier of coverage I would like I was informed of a corresponding wellness program.

In order to avoid the surcharges you must submit a Biometric Screening (weight, body fat composition, blood pressure, lipid panel, among other things) to HR as well as earn additional points by reaching target BMI, cholesterol levels, and even participating in telephonic or online \"health coaching sessions\".\n \nI'm a non smoker but admittedly a little over weight. Truthfully it's not an issue of being able to meet these goals but I don't feel like I should be required to share medical information with my employer that isn't relevant to my job responsibilities.\n\nl loosely understand how this type of thing can be enforced under the ACA but it seems to have some grey area regarding discriminatory actions under EEOC and ADA. \n\nI asked my employer if participation in the wellness program was mandatory and they informed me that if I wanted to enroll in the company healthcare plan that the wellness program was also required.\n\nIt may wind up being a moot point as I have another employement offer in the pipelines but I'm still really curious about what my rights are here and what courses of action I could pursue.",

    "post": "I've been with this guy. for about 6 months now. We dated for about a month before he asked to be exclusive. Things were going great initially, as most budding romances do, but lately I'm wondering if my feelings have been fleeting. He's been wonderful to me, and we get along great, but I don't seem to feel a spark.\n\nI feel conflicted, this is probably the best relationship I've been in in terms of it being the healthiest (my last relationship was an abusive relationship ending in my arrest when I defended myself against him).  All of my previous relationships were involved with guys that were addicted (drinking, smoking weed, etc) or cheating. My current boyfriend doesn't drink, smoke, and has never cheated.  \n\nPart of me is wondering if I'm bored because I don't have the 'excitement' of being in a terrible relationship. Lately I've been thinking about all of the things that I don't like about him, but I'm wondering if that may be symptomatic of the fact that I'm bored.  I mean, am I just bored with this particular man or is it possible to have a healthy, honest relationship with a man that I feel passion for at the same time?\n\nHonestly I don't know if I'm being selfish and I should break up with him so he can find someone that feels just as strongly about him as he does with me, or if I should take a look at the relationship with a new perspective. I don't know if love and passion grow over time but if I have become turned off 6 months in I'm wondering if I should end things.",

Anyway my friend came over with her 10 month old mini pit who was beggggggging Oliver to play with him and I tried to initiate with some fetch thinking thatll warm him up. Nope, took his toy and hid right under the desk. When the puppy came over to sniff at him he growled. I took him out from under the desk gave his toy to the pit and had him lay down next to him but now my friend/ boyfriend are telling me to look up methods to socialize him. Honestly I think he acts perfectly fine with other dogs, other then not playing with them. Is this just his personality like I suspect or am I keeping him from something that he could learn to really love by not going about it the right way?",

We also have financial support from both our families in case of emergency, so we have no worries about our ability to pay for it. We are apparently $400 short of what is required for income, and they have requested proof of income for at least that amount from another income source. My boyfriend does do housework for his grandfather in exchange for $15/hour and has made between $400-$500 a month since September. \n\nThe apartment went ahead and processed our application and plan to have us sign the lease November 30th, they also told us to go ahead and get the electricity bill in our name. So it seems like they've already got the ball rolling and expect us to provide an acceptable proof of income. \n\nNow my question is, do you think [this]( is a good enough proof of income? This is how my boyfriend has been tracking his hours and how much his grandfather has paid him. \n\nThanks ahead of time for input!

We try for a good long time to get him in (because the lube burned, I didn't bother with much preparatory work...) but it just wasn't taking. Eventually, there's this sort of....silent pop.

Since then, they have been splitting time with son more or less evenly. There are no court orders, neither party has paid any child support to the other. Yesterday sister got a text from ex. It was a photo of a paternity test that says ex and son are not related. Sister never tried to trap him, in fact I'm sure she would not have had the child if she thought it was anyone other than his. And not that it matters, in a legal sense, but I just feel the need to point out that sister and ex's relationship basically began when he convinced her to keep the baby and start a family with him. This wasn't a baby born out of infidelity. Anyway I guess the hospital estimated the due date wrong and she actually got pregnant a few weeks earlier than the doctors thought. Anyway, I guess what I'm wondering is if he can take her to court to try to get money out of her. I understand it must be an awful thing to raise a child as your own for two years just to find out it's not your child after all. Sister feels awful about the whole thing but she just wants to make sure she's prepared for anything he could potentially throw at her. Thanks.",
